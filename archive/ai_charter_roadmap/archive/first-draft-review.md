# AI Charter & Roadmap — First Draft Review

**Meeting**: Zack 1:1
**Purpose**: Get alignment on direction before building the full deck

---

## The Pitch (30 seconds)

We built a data foundation in 2025 (Buying Groups, Email Sync, Conversation Intelligence). Now we're putting AI on top of it to surface the right context at the right moment — so reps spend time selling, not searching.

---

## The Charter

> **Build an always-on intelligence layer that gathers context from every rep interaction and turns it into guidance at the moment of need.**

### Principles
1. **Foundation First** — AI is only as good as its data
2. **Meet People Where They Work** — Salesforce, Planhat, Slack
3. **Context, Not Complexity** — Don't overwhelm
4. **Anticipate, Don't Ask** — Surface what's needed before they search

---

## Who We're Building For

| Audience | Their Question | Our Answer |
|----------|----------------|------------|
| Sales | "What should I do next?" | AI-powered deal guidance |
| Partner Success | "Which accounts need me?" | Proactive health signals |
| Leadership | "Where do I coach?" | Evidence-based visibility |

## The Story Arc (for the presentation)

```
Problem → Foundation → What's Live → What's Next → Vision
```

1. **Problem**: Reps do work, but it doesn't accumulate. Context doesn't connect.
2. **Foundation (2025)**: Buying Group data model, Email sync, Conversation intelligence
3. **What's Live**: Next Steps Hygiene (AI suggests next actions)
4. **What's Next**: Deal Risk Signals, expanded Buying Group research
5. **Vision**: Intelligence layer that makes your past work guide your next move

# GTM Systems AI Charter

## Mission

**Every interaction becomes insight.**

The right context, at the right moment.

---

## The Problem We're Solving

The commercial team does a lot of work — calls, emails, meetings, research.

That work doesn't accumulate. Every interaction starts from scratch.

**We're changing that.**

---

## Who We Serve

- **Sales** — "What should I do next?"
- **Partner Success** — "Which accounts need me?"
- **Leadership** — "Where do I coach?"
- **Supporting Teams** — "How do we help the field?"

## Our Principles

1. **Foundation First** — AI is only as good as the data it has access to.
2. **Meet People Where They Work** — Salesforce, Planhat, Slack. We go to them.
3. **Context, Not Complexity** — Right information. Right moment. Don't overwhelm.
4. **Anticipate, Don't Ask** — The best systems know what you need before you search.

## The Standard

> **We're not building AI for AI's sake. We're building tools that make you more effective.**

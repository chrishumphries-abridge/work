# CKO AI Foundations Breakout - Prep with Sarah

## Session Details

- **Event**: CKO Breakout Session (choose your own adventure)
- **When**: Wednesday 11:15 AM (45 min)
- **Format**: Panel/moderated discussion in breakout room (~50 people max)
- **Theme**: AI Foundations - "Flattening the curve" on AI adoption

## Structure Decided

1. **Chris's Corner (15-20 min)**: Market perspective, where AI is heading
2. **Panel/Q&A (25-30 min)**: Reps share how they actually use AI day-to-day

## Key Themes to Cover

- Where AI market is heading (Forrester insights on flipped sales process)
- Using the right tools the right way (approved tech stack)
- Trial and error is normal - learning process
- Tie AI to tangible workflow, not open-ended prompting

## Decisions

- Format: Panel discussion over hands-on exercise
- Panelists: ICs and managers both welcome
- Zach Anderson confirmed as panelist (early adopter)
- Chris has free reign on slides; Sarah provides pitch template
- Breakout room = flexible AV (just plug in laptop)

## Open Items

> [!warning] Potential Stage Appearance
> Jeremy mentioned possible RevOps/Marketing "Apple keynote" style presentation (Jeremy + Guru on stage). Sarah will loop Chris in once they decide. Could be good lead-in to breakout session.

> [!note] Opportunity Analysis Demo
> Could showcase as "early access" preview - needs Jeremy approval first.

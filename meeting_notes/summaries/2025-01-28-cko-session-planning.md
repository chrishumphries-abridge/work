# CKO AI Foundations Session Planning

## Session Structure (Agreed)

### Opening (~15 min) - "Chris's Corner"
- 1-2 market stats (e.g., 67% clinicians using AI daily, 90% weekly)
- 1-2 poll questions via Mentimeter or Kahoot (QR code)
- Audience size TBD after registration opens

### Three Content Sections
1. **AI Foundations** - What is an LLM? Generative vs agentic. Basic glossary.
2. **Prompting 101** - Who prompts? How to do it better. Possible "AI Mad Libs" exercise.
3. **Tech Stack Overview** - ChatGPT vs Claude vs Perplexity. What Abridge offers access to.

## Key Framing
- Not "how to be a better commercial person with AI"
- More: "current lay of the land + how to apply in day-to-day"
- Step one of a year-long AI enablement program
- Meet people where they are (spectrum from nothing → Claude Code)
- Responsible use - acknowledge potential negative impacts

## Logistics
- Breakout room format (not main stage)
- Conversational, not formal
- Marketing/Jyotsna can help with slide design
- Walk-on music plays as people enter (no headshot needed for this one)
- Monday rehearsal includes tech check for this deck

## Potential ALCO Main Stage Session
- Pending exec approval (Sarah to confirm EOD)
- If approved: 500 people, Apple keynote style, Jeremy as MC
- Would need: walk-on music, better headshot
- Sarah suggested: do CKO content at ALCO instead, slot someone else for CKO breakout

## Related: Buying Groups Feedback
> [!note] Context from Vito's team session
> - Not hitting with end users - perceived as data entry
> - Feels like management oversight tool ("big brother-y")
> - Jeremy's scoring plans (breadth, depth, frequency) may increase pushback
> - Next Steps feedback has been more positive
> - Peter and Chris to sync on easy wins

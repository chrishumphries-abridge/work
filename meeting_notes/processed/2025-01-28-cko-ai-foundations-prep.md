# CKO Prep Sync - Sarah (Enablement)

## Transcript

Sorry, Sarah. Hey, no worries. How's it going?

Good, how are you?

I'm good. Your vibe coding looks awesome.

Thank you. I can't take all the credit for it. But it's been fun for sure.

Has no one used it yet?

I think so. Nice. Which is cool. So, yeah.

Cool. So, I don't know if Jeremy has mentioned this in passing at all. He hasn't. I have no idea. Perfect. So, okay. So, I'll do an overview of CKO in general. Obviously, it's in a few weeks now. One of the time slots that we have. Let me share my screen here. is gonna be like a choose your own adventure of short sorts for the team to split off into three different breakouts. Okay. So we'll have one that's like, you know, a PSD, a sales director and I am all talking about how they collab.

One will be a marketing session. And then one I was thinking could be fun is more of like a foundational AI session. So more so talking about, and we can brainstorm in a second too, but I'm kind of thinking like going back to the basics for the commercial org, for them, like how do they prompt right? Right. Like when I think of like, Zach Anderson, the attention helper, just being like, Please help me with this.

It's like, there might be a better way to probably get what you're asking for using our tech stack. Specifically, we'll need to make sure that we're like using the approved tech stack from Zach Powers, but help me at the hackathon at least. And in one other thing, so I'll share these with you after if you wanna check them out. When Jyotsna, David and I went to an enablement conference a few months ago, they had two sessions that I thought had really interesting insights that maybe we can pull from.

One, and this was from a vendor, so like 70% of it isn't applicable, but it was like AI fluency specifically talking about for like ICs and reps. So I think some of these slides we could probably like take a look at and see what we could take just like. Okay. 101 basics. And then I think also what could be interesting to kind of set the stage at the beginning and this is a recording from someone from Forrester, but it's like where the market is heading in terms of AI.

So, Let me see if there's like, well, let me zoom forward into the... Let's see, this is current. Oh yeah, so this is like an interesting slide that they showed, but just like This is the current sales process that people are familiar with. But in I think this was like in five to seven years was their analysis. I can make it bigger like where AI they think is the market's going to be heading, which essentially is just flipping everything on its because when you think about like I think healthcare is probably going to be a little bit delayed in this, but like a CMIO isn't going to take 10 demos with vendors.

They're going to ask Chachi PT what's the best vendor for me and then have their top one or two and then do demos after they already make a decision. So there are some interesting insights like that that I think we could just like take 10 minutes at the beginning to maybe set the stage with. And then... we can brainstorm more on what we think we would want, but I think then maybe pulling up some Like reps, PSDs, IMs, maybe even Andy if he wants to because I know he's in a lot to talk about how they've put some best practices and like utilize it in their day-to-day life.

It's kind of like a time saver. So we can kind of just help you like facilitators versus like... running the book session.

So, just take a step back. Yeah. I am presenting at CKO. Oh, that is Notion.

Well, so with enablement. So we can see if we want to more so prepare slides. If we want this to be just like a panel.

If that just me, it's with you guys.

Yes, yes, yes. Don't worry, we would not leave you hanging.

What day is it on? This is gonna be on a Wednesday, going back to this deck. This will be at Wednesday at 11:15 AM. And I'll make sure we have calendar holds and all of that. stuff too. So let me go into So me plus y'all are doing a session on foundational AI, basically.

And it will not be in the main ballroom. It's going to be in a breakout room. Let's say max 50 or so people are on it. So it won't be anything too intimidating. And if we just want to go panel route and you moderate a panel with a bunch of reps who use AI, we can do that too. That's the easiest thing, obviously, to put together. But I thought it could be cool because I know you don't get quite as much FaceTime I want to kind of get some insight into like, here's what I see from the market.

And you know, some of the stuff that you've shared with us.

Yeah, so basically kind of a Chris's Corner idea, but at scale.

Exactly. And we'll have 45 dedicated minutes. So... Let's say like 15 to 20. is like Chris's corner and then the other part can maybe be a panel or maybe it's one or two reps pull up how they're actually using it. Like it's like,Okay, Chris, like you're gonna show everyone how to prompt. Now they all have an activity or something to like pull something up potentially. So we can kind of brainstorm, but I think Does that structure sound good?

That's great.

Yeah. Cool. Okay. I'll do whatever you guys think is best there.

Perfect. And then as far as what we want to showcase, like, what do you think a panel would be best? Do you think... Showing people like, let's say the top three things we want them to actually like pull up their laptops and play around with.

Yeah, it's a good question. I think it'd be interesting for me to probably hear from reps on how they're doing it. I think that would both. Yep. Because to me, the big thing with all this AI stuff is like a big goal for me. And that's what I'm trying to do with a lot of this is like, how do we flatten kind of like the curve around AI? Exactly. I was trying to find a way, but with a caveat of like, we need to be doing it the right way, you know, like in the right tools and that sort of thing.

Like if I just go to Salesforce and to GPT and say, hey,I've researched this medical system. I might get varied results versus me saying, we can even pull up that, that example of that prep doc.

That was like, they're, they're focused on efficiency. They laid off 7,000 people. Remember that response that we got?

Exactly. So it's like, it's like that thing too, of like, you know, I think one time I was Zach, he was like, I can do this myself, but he basically was like force feeding and everything. And I'm like, well, that's always going to give a certain kind of result, you know? Yep. So I think also hammer on like a lot of this is trial and error. A lot of this is like figuring out how it works. hopefully flattening kind of the jumping off of everyone just like okay I can walk away and do this perfect yeah I think I think the panel approach or kind of like the hearing the reps talk to us approach also helps us inform for like future development of like what can we go do that would help them you know yeah I kind of sit in the vacuum of like I basically build what Jeremy and Zach think we need right and so but and so I think like finding the balance of like you you know, what do reps do and what do they need?

That would help us also know like, okay, like actually maybe we're missing something or whatever as well. So I think I would, as opposed to trying to kind of like do exercise, probably more of a moderation would be good. I think from there.

Perfect. Yeah. I think that's super easy to put together. I think. Zach Anderson is like a very logical choice for some of this. Like to your point, like you've done work with him. He has trial and errors on his own, right? I think he's like an early adopter. Is there anyone else that you can think of that... Could be.

There's no one that I talk to regularly. I don't know on y'all's. I mean, he's like, that's all I think is kind of funny with like these things that we roll out a bridge helper and like he's like one of the channel using it at all. You know, right. It's like it's that maybe it's I mean, you know, I see errands in there, but I know they're relatively new. But it's like, I don't know. What do you think?

I don't know a lot of folks out that I've really seen doing Stuff like that at this point. Do y'all have anyone that comes to mind for y'all?

Yeah, I'll have to think on the PX side.

Not all the times, would it be ICs or also managers in that panel?

No, I think it could be managers too. I think this like really like to your point, like this is like a 101 flatting the curve session for anyone who, we all talk about AI all day, but do we all feel comfortable putting it to work in our--Well, I think that's the thing. And maybe it's almost better too to also be like, whoever's in there i mean i know we could may target some folks yep but then also like whoever is in there like can we just open it up but then that could be also no one would answer i don't know but i think that's i think no one answering can also open it up to an interesting discussion too on and maybe it's like rather than a panel it could be like you zach and me prompting questions to people and like zach can give his tidbits from his experience but it could be more questions on like what is scary to you is it that you don't like the way it comes out is it that you don't know how to And I think we can even bring it back to like, what are you using it in your day-to-day life?

Right? Like I'm sure there's a lot of people who are using it more in their personal lives too than even work. And I think little things like, like up here, I'll just start making notes. Like, like the ability to put it in your own voice. Um. I don't know if there's a certain term for that, but I think that one's like one people probably don't know about. You can upload a sample and get it. To where you want it, um...

Yeah. Yeah, I have an idea of likeNotion AI is like a gray area one because I knowI don't think Zach Powers is super-All right. Well, and like the meeting, which I'm ironic because I'm using it now, but like the Notion meeting I know is like legal, does not want that because it's like, If you're doing it with a partner behind the scenes, they don't know you're recording, which is technically illegal.

So that's probably too, like I have to think about it.

I like it for internal for my notes because notion doesn't fill that gap. But I mean, because attention doesn't.

The context is like almost all of my meetings are internal. Actually all of them are. Whereas I guess a person like, you know, on the commercial side would probably be much more external. Yeah.

So it's also like, you know, a way of that as well.

I mean, one thing I'm doing with this time is like some like day planning type stuff and some, you know, where it's like basically pulling in tasks. building out a plan for the day. You know, that could be, that could be an interesting thing we could consider is like, and I'm not, this is an over promise, but like, could we even like care with like, I could consider building something that might like a little thing for me.

I don't know. That could be too much.

Oh yeah. Like maybe that's like that cook, like in the description, cause people are going to select these. Right. So maybe it's like people People who come walk away with early access to some new... AI tool or something.

Well, we have this like, so Trey has this new thing we could do where like, I've been doing it where like, it made the hooks into my Google calendar into my Asana stuff.

And it basically allows me to like pull in my calls and emails and my schedule and my task and like a document to kind of help plan out the day oh yeah that i mean i in theory think that would be so helpful for everyone i think we would just that one we probably need to have a bigger conversation with yes yes zach powers about because but like I know that when Frank was here, he was looking at getting us Glean, which can do the same thing at an org-wide level.

I don't know where we're landing with that, I'm assuming.

Well, we could actually even point it at Salesforce and pull in... calendar events potentially that we already logged there. Yeah. So it's not like, you know, tapping into everyone's direct connections. Right. Or even just like, yeah, let's don't commit to, maybe we like could do some like kind of like alpha type, like here's some ideas that might.

Yeah. And like, I think you could still like, like the abridge helper, like we could have them come up with a prompt to help them do that too, based on their calls for the day. Like, yeah. Like, Hey, what are my top three action items based on yesterday's calls or whatever? Like that's super easy.

You need to kind of tie it to something tangible they can think through. Because I think that's the hard part too. When you go to the user chat, you have this open-ended text box. It's not really curated on anything. For me, it's like you can position this more so into like their workflow that's useful too yeah Yeah. Because it'd be kind of mean maybe it's overkill they kind of kind of like kind of build out this neat preview of something that could be coming.

I don't know. That could be that. Maybe that's ambitious, though.

It might be ambitious, but it could also be, I think at minimum, if not something that like we build out, maybe we have like a mini prompt library that we start coming up with. And like, that's something they can walk away with that they can use.

Let me show you this. Oh, yeah. And then maybe like...

I mean, if I'm off topic, tell me. This stuff is just so fun. It's like, it's easy just to get crazy with it. Go see. This probably would need, like, Jeremy approval too, but I will... Yeah. He's not even seen it, so we'll see. So I have this thing here. So we launched this next steps thing. Yep. And we have, this is not hidden, but it's a part of this year, but it's like this opportunity analysis thing.

So let me see. So we could use this as an example of like, you know, Like basically we could consider some like prompting ideas from this view. And what it does is actually goes and like prompts against the opportunity and like brings best. It's like an ad hoc prompting kind of thing.

Oh, that's cool. Yeah.

So it's like, we can, so this basically gives like, you know, a review of the deal. That makes sense. You know? Oh yeah.

And this is only for opportunities right now or can you do it for accounts too?

Right now, we can do it for accounts too. Yeah. But like maybe it'd be cool if I have some like example prompts here. Yeah. Something like that. Or a custom prompt thing too. I don't know, like a prompt builder type thing? Yeah. I don't know, but this could be something fun to show. Maybe, I don't know.

Yeah, I think that'd be cool. Yeah, I think anything that you feel comfortable, either like early access or even it could just be like showcasing and be like, Does this hit? Is this still intimidating? Would you do it? I think that'd be really cool.

To me, this is what we're trying to do on our side, really, is like... Where do we as opposed to like saying you could do this in GPT or slack it's almost like where are you spending all your time. How do we not like because to me the guardrails part is important to like make sure we give them enough kind of rope to go with but it's not like a thing where it's like just do whatever you want because it's kind of like that's our biggest going to be like our biggest kind of contender is like someone that just rolls their own all the time and it's like.

you know, we can't, we can't like, it's hard to support that. Right. So, yeah. Let me think about some ideas. I'm into that. And maybe a way of giving something kind of early or something like that too could be interesting to do.

Okay. I'm going to share this doc with you. This is fully your outline, so feel free to mark it up however you want. There's some prompts at the top with goals and stuff. That's more for... if you want it to help, but you don't have to fill it out by any means. So that was going to be my next thing. So at the top, there are some milestones, but I would say like, because it's us working on it, it's a little bit more flexible than like a VP, for example.

So I would say if we get in a good place, let's say by like next Friday for the outline. And that way, if there's any reps like Zach, we want to get involved. That gives us a solid week to prep them on what to talk about too. And then technically, I... if we need any this will be in a breakout so we're a little bit more flexible but let's say draft slides by like the 6th that friday before cko and then we still have a few working days if we need to to tweak anything this is gonna be a breakout room where we're just plugging our own laptop into the breakout so it's more flexible than like av having to upload it to their production system okay um So I can edit it.

I'm going to say.

So as far as slides, am I making slides or are you guys making slides?

I think it's up to you. We're gonna have a pitch template. So that's a good starting point. And I can put in some thoughts from my two decks that I shared that could be helpful. But if you wanna fill in anything from like, Your perspective on like market, Chris's Corner, that type of stuff, I think have at it too. You have free reign and then we can meet again to like continue prepping and see what we want to cover.

Yeah, that's fine. Cool. I like it.

Awesome. I'm excited. I think this will be a good session.

There's nothing else. This is my only responsibility for CKO is this.

Jeremy did mention something about it coming on stage with marketing and RevOps, but he gave me no information on that.

Okay, just let me know. He mentioned like a vision casting something and that, I don't know what that even means.

And so that was a few weeks ago. What did he mention?

We are doing something called vision casting, but it's, we're revealing our new positioning. As an organization. So that's like a marketing thing. It's not a you thing. He's not saying anything to us.

I mean, honestly, now they're having their little off-site deal.

So I don't know if that's going to happen.

The only thing that might happen is... Which timing is changing on this now, but... marketing and RevOps are going to have a co, think of like an Apple keynote where like Guru.

That's it.

Yeah. Jeremy and Guru are going to be on stage. And I think we might, they might call up certain people just to like hype everyone on like really cool stuff that's coming. There might be something there, but we'll, we'll have another prep meeting like this to once they figure out what they want to do.

So we'll be more, we'll, we'll be in the loop on that before.

Yeah. And that could actually also be perfect though. Cause if you are on the stage, hypothetically here, the session the next day and be like, want to know more? Tomorrow we have the session come by. Right.

Okay. And so on the night, is that actual rehearsal? Like that's the Monday.

Do we need to be there to rehearse things?

What is your flight schedule? Because we can also find time.

I think I get in at three. Okay. Yeah. I think I'm bidding whatever y'all ask us to do as far as time goes.

Okay. Perfect. Yeah. So we can either find some time that day or we can find time Tuesday during the sessions and just pop out for a little bit and do it then too. Okay. Great.

Yeah. Awesome. Okay. Great. I'm excited. Thanks, Sarh. I'm excited. Bye. Bye.

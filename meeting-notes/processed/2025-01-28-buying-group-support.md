## Transcript

Oh, here we go. Hey, bud.

Hey, how are you, man? Good to see you.

Good. Yeah, same to you. This works out good because I actually have another question that came out.

Oh, sure. Yeah, anything.

Two birds, one stone, that whole thing. Cool. All right. So the first thing though that's bugging me is it would... It would show up on my dashboard if I had these. Yeah. I had CIOs, CMIOs that weren't. Okay. That weren't. Right? So... So I know I have done those. So it makes me wonder, like, something unraveled or they were deleted or something, right? Sure.

Show me one of those that is causing confusion for you and we can work backwards from that.

Yeah, I guess it's possible that I didn't, because I know there was a huge post to make sure you get all of these. Here's the report. Right. And so... key accounts that I know I wouldn't have missed. So that's the thing that'sSo there's this little sales director dashboard here, right? Yeah. Of course. So right here. So I was just going through this because I, well, what happened, what triggered this is I got a couple of new accounts because, you know, one of the sales guys left in December.

And so when they read... So I have a couple of new accounts and I'm like, holy shit, like I have a few of these that I have to, they weren't mine. Anyway, so I looked at this and this, Great.

Yeah, we'll see what's going on there.

We've been doing a lot of work on this.

There's a chance that something's not even like wrong on your part. So let me see if I can see what's going on there. So click into one of those.

Yeah, so CHA, this one's giving me trouble. Okay. The number one, I just updated that. That one seemed to work. That was good. And then Oneida. So if I click into... CHAOkay, I got it.

Yeah. Yeah, this is probably not, let me. That's an opportunity.

Okay, so I was able to add Dr. Galvin. Yeah. But so what's happening is, And this is right now. You're buying, this is correct. There's one member and that's what you've added thus far. for this. Correct. But I did, I added it today apparently, even though I added it whenever I think.

That connected thing just means like how long, when the last time you guys communicated. Gotcha.

Gotcha. All right. Okay. So if I do this, so the CIO is Jeanette. She's a CIO. I went into her profile, her account contact, and everything's in there. So I click on that.

So scroll down to the bottom of this screen real quick. There you go. And then you can map her right there. It's all good. I know this is all very new, so don't, it's okay.

What an idiot.

No, no, no, no, don't take, don't, that's not the case.

Okay. I literally, I just didn't scroll down.

Okay. No, no, that's on us. I can take this as feedback and get it, make it better.

No, no, I should. Cause I think I went through that before. I might've gone through that before, but all right, well, that's fine. So cool. Um, let me just go through this. So she's the, the icing champion. Now I feel like a blown head.

No, no, no. This is literally hot off the presses, so don't stress that.

He's actually not the CFO, but he's the closest to it. He's just chief administrative officer, but one person is CFO right now because they don't really have one. uh, So we'll do that for now. Okay. Well, that was easy. That makes sense. Sweet. Okay. So there's the, so that, okay. So that works. Yeah. So there was it. So that's the way to do it, I guess.

So now that's what I was going to say. I'm actually going to remove that button off the buying group in a minute. This is where you want to come now to do this is here. And so it kind of keeps it all in one place from there. Do me a favor, though. How about that opportunity that was flagging a new report and I can look and see if that looks right or not? Um. in your The one that was showing up that shouldn't have been there.

Yeah, let me go back to the dashboard.

Okay, yeah.

Let's go back to the dashboard real quick. Uh... Where am I? Oh, there we go. Okay.

Do you run a refresh to make sure you see how that's looking? Okay, so I think this might be more of a data thing I can fix. Click on that real quick and let's go to the opportunity there. Yeah, that one right there.

Right. Oh, I don't think I attached it to...

Okay, so it should have already happened, which is that's on our end. If you can do this for me, go back to the account page real quick. And then there's a button right there in the middle where you add, set a link. Yep. Right there. And you can click that opportunity you want to add it to. And that's fine as well if you want to do it. I think you need to do, I think it's... Let's see. Let's do one at a time.

I think I might just want one. Let's see. Okay. Uh, That's weird. Okay. Don't let me fix this for you real quick. And I'll figure this here, but this part out and I'll get it off.

It says already attached.

Okay. Give me a second to explore why that's shown on your, I can see this as you and I can see what's going on here and get this fixed. Cause this, this should be right now. So. I'll just say, TLDR, don't stress it right now. I'll get it fixed.

Yeah, that's fine. Okay. Want to go through the other question? Sure. Let's do it. All right. So here's the deal. So on one of these, I actually have to add... So another example, Oneida Health came up. And again, I... I assume I was pretty positive that I had already done this, but it could be wrong. Whatever, that's fine. So I'm doing it. And so I go to add a member and I actually don't have... My key contacts, which is crazy.

I kind of knew it moved quick. Whatever. That's fine. So I'm going to go add him. His name is Brad Chrysler. So he's already in the system. So let's just say I don't know that. So I'm going to click new. And I'm going to start... Um... Well, just let's pretend we don't know this exists yet. Yeah. But I start, I type in his email address and Brad and the system tells me, There's a dupe. Okay. Well, that's what's going on.

Why didn't you tell me those are two?

Probably once you try to save it will.

What are you did? Let me just. So I want to go through the actual workflow. OK. That's annoying. Just bear with me because I want to see what else.

Yeah, I'll move you. All right.

Here's the email. Okay, right there. So similar records exist. Okay, great. So that makes it easy so I can pull it. So now I go to view duplicates and There's the lead. Okay. It's not pulling up. Why isn't it pulling it up? Let's say I click on it and this is the action that brings me to. How do I attach this? to the account. Yep.

Let me make a one-line. I'm on my end taking one look. Let's see.

I guess the question, up front is, is this something every time I have to send to RevOps or can I do this onNo, no, no. Yeah.

I'll show you. Give me one second. Let's see it. Okay.

What I tried to do is I just changed. I changed the the the company, make sure it matched the match account and refresh and it didn't do that. So I start.

So do this, scroll to the top real quick if you can and then hit change converted status right there. Let's see what this says. Hit cancel on that. And then go, I mean, put my annotation on here. Go here. And then do convert. Okay, so what you're going to do here, this basically is how you would create a new lead. All you have to do is go here and search for Oneida right there. There you go.

Okay. So I've seen this before. Yeah. So I thought that would have... popped out as I was converting the lead.

And all of this looks right to me as well here too. And you may just want to change the owner to you right there. Sorry, I think it took it away. Because Brad does not exist as a contact. I checked for him. He's not in there yet. There's no, so you want to create a new contact for Brad. Yeah. And then... Okay. That looks right.

And then to the email address.

down here on the owner, just change that owner to you if you can. And I think that's right there. You don't have to, you can leave that. Yeah, unless you want to link him to it. That's okay. That's fine too. Yep. All right. Right. Okay. And then you would just convert this from there.

Okay, so right there.

Okay.

Yeah, so all right. So what I had done, I won't hold you up here. I don't know if you get it wrong or something.

You're fine. You're fine. So, um, Yeah, once that loads.

Yeah, so I think it was in just open status. Yeah. So, So I went through and tried to convert it that way. So I sort of expected the window to pop up, but now that I know you're on the left side. So that's cool. So go back. I just want to make sure everything kind of pulled over.

I would just refresh everything. Make sure you refresh your page here. And then go back to the account view. He should be there now. There he is. Awesome.

All right.

Cool. And now you can add it in the buying group.

Yeah. Awesome. All right. Yeah, I think that's it.

Perfect. Okay. I will look into what's going on with the opportunity side of that looks right to me and I'll see what's, what's goofy there and I'll, whatever issues I'll get that cleaned up for you. So I didn't show that error anymore.

Actually, one last thing. I think this is maybe Ramon and Catherine Oliver. But when new deals come in, and they get closed one, is it those guys that take care of that? Yes, that's correct. Yep. Okay. So I have one coming in hopefully like anytime and we're trying to get them kicked off before CKO. Okay. And I've been talking with implementation. So I'm basically just trying to like get the whole process done ASAP. So I just want to give it up. Yeah. They're the right folks for that for sure.

Absolutely. All right.

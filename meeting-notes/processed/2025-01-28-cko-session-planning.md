# Meeting Transcript

with Vito's team, they had a lot of thoughts. Oh, okay.

Were you part of their team meeting?

They did a special session on buying groups with me and Peter. Probably wasn't very helpful, but I did listen to what they were saying. Yeah. Yeah.

It's like, you do kind of wonder what is kind of the cliff where these things are like, it's kind of the line between like people just don't want to do the work versus... Like, what actually should we keep developing towards, you know? I'm sure you see that all the time in your role as well. I do.

Yeah, I feel like, like... Well, Sarah's note-taker is on, but I feel like... The enthusiasm that Jeremy has with his buying group products is not...

That's what's hard is like, I think I'm insulated inside that bubble. And it's like that feedback he's giving is very great and palpable and like fun to be a part of but it's like I'm hope I'm working it's like you know the college actually end users and it's like This is a hitting Like we thought it was.

It's not hitting. That's the reality of it.

I do wonder, though, like, I mean, is it a thing that will if we keep on kind of pushing it or what? Or is it just is it just a bad approach? You know, I don't know.

Did they give feedback on the next steps?

No, we didn't look at that at all. No. I've had a few discussions on that.

The feedback on the next steps has been a little bit more positive.

That has been better. Yeah, I know. I think it's just– I think– I mean, it's definitely data entry, and I agree with that for sure on that point. I think it's just... I don't think we're... quite yet distilling down like the full vision of, I don't, honestly, I just don't know because like I'm just kind of building what, you know, we kind of were deciding we need to build. And I think it's hard to really know.

I think it's hard when you have like ops people thinking this is helpful, but then the actual end users thinking this is not helpful.

Yeah. That's kind of where we are right now.

Well, I guess I guess they were trying to share what value and answer is kind of for them, you know, to like, what does it really do? It's a great way to kind of centralize who. you know, you're trying to work with, I guess, but, um, But it almost feels like to some degree more of like a... management oversight tool sometimes too. Like a way for, you know, a management to hop on.

That's how some people feel it to be, right?

Yeah. Especially with all the scores and stuff.

Right. And Jeremy wants to do more scoring and this layer is going to be even more kind of like... I would say punitive almost.

I would say if you do too much, it's going to be more big brother-y. Yeah.

He wants to score on breadth, depth, and frequency, which basically is like... No, that's basically looking at... Yeah, yeah, I know.

It's looking at, like, activity, and that's when you, people get annoyed.

That's what, yeah, that's what's tricky is, like, it's, you know, that's the hard, like, you're kind of this echo chamber of, like, we're developing these things that do this stuff, and then it's like... Yeah. Yeah, it's hitting the marks that we're defining, but then it's like, is it actually useful for the greater, you know, team as well? Yeah, and how they perceive it. Right. So, Peter and I will sync up.

They gave some good feedback. We can definitely... Pretty easy wins to kind of make it easier for sure. But I do wonder though, is it ever going to be a thing that's like actually useful to a sales rep? You know?

I think some people... Will.

I think there's just a little bit of hesitation to it right at the moment. Right. Right. We'll see.

Okay. That's all you can do.

Hey Sarah. Hey. Sorry. I had to pick new furniture because the design did not approve our original furniture that we already brought on site to the frickin' hotel. So. Yeah. They wanted us to purchase $600 chairs. And luckily Stride found a provider where you can rent the chairs for $35 each. So super, super fun.

It was fun. At my old job, I was like much more tied to like the RKO type stuff than I am now.

Oh really?

And like, we never had like a stride or anything that was like, you know, like y'all that's cool. This is an operation. This is a big production. You know, we were like, we would have ours in this like rinky dink room that basically like, you know, the zoom barely worked effectively.

Yeah. And this is more like, this is a level of like a, like a stage production.

Yeah, it's... It's a little unnecessary at times, but you know. I'm like, why does design have to design the Wi-Fi sign, but it will look cool. Yeah.

No, that's right.

I think that's what I'm most nervous about. These presentations just like, are they designed correctly?

You know? No, don't worry. Um, well, the great thing is during this time, marketing is holding a session. So I'm sure the entire marketing team is going to sit in on that session for support. Right.

So can this just be like in a corner of a lobby somewhere we could do it where it's just not, you know, like a come and go type thing.

It won't be in the big room at least. It's going to be fine. I think we'll be good. I heard from like three people on the other panel who were like, oh my God, I wish I could go to that session.

And I was like, oh, okay, well that's good.

That makes me feel good. Are you, are you tied in at all to what's happening with the main day? Like the first day of our, Jeremy said, I might talk then too. Have you heard that?

Well, yeah, I prepped you on that. Remember?

No, no, no. This is the third one. Like... Oh...

Yes, but... It's not approved yet by the executive team that we're having that session.

Okay.

You know what that is? I'm just trying to get as prepared as I can be even before I know it's happening.

I think we actually should have a conversation about that. If it ends up getting, I should know by the end of the day, we're waiting for the execs to sign off. If we have that session, I kind of feel like it doesn't make sense for you to do what you were going to do during CKO. You should do that during the ALCO one. And then Jeremy should slot someone else in during CKO. You know what I mean?

Okay. Well, the way we're dialing in, and don't take any of my reactions as towards anybody. I'm just like nervous. And so that's all. I just didn't, I'm new at this stuff. CKO slot is basically around pretty like Salesforce focus and like kind of like CKO focused content. And so I would say if I was going to pick and choose, I would rather do the... CKO when you know because I mean that'll probably land a little better but he said it may sound like the other one's like more of like a general like how I'm using AI type session yeah I think we're still finalizing it and stuff too or what I don't I don't know yeah so that one that one will be at Alco in front of the entire like 500 person company okay so if you guys find me having been laying in a corner just know that this just you know it's okay like um so you'll be fine I was telling you team that like I grew up like you know I grew up in a pretty conservative like religious context and I'm not a part of that anymore but part of the thing we did we competed on like public speaking so I would like go to these like I would go to these big conventions and like compete on who's the best like Jesus speaker and so I've got I'm ready for this is my point but at the same time you know very the audience is a lot different.

Let's pretend that AI is Jesus. That's right.

You're in Alabama right? I am yeah. It's funny because in my last role I had like in revolves in my last I had a girl from Mississippi who literally said the same thing. She was so like introverted.

She never talked to anyone, but she was like, I'm really good at public speaking because I used to have to go to like these like religious conferences. Isn't that crazy? It is in Nashville. And it was basically like this massive event where we went and like, we did like, guys, I was in high school and we did puppet shows. Like it's so weird. Like it's embarrassing to even talk about really.

But it's funny, she moved to San Francisco and she said the same thing. She's like, I like left it when I went to college.

Oh yeah, I'm, I'm not a part of it anymore, but it's just like, it's weird stuff, you know? So yeah. Yeah. But honestly, it was preparing me in a way I didn't know. So that's okay too. I still have the little awards that I won from it. It's like so weird.

Awesome. I didn't realize that. I look at him every morning.

Awesome. But he's going to be so nervous and I'm like, he'll be fine.

Yeah, you'll be fine. Especially in this breakout then. Put you on the main stage.

Yeah, I might fall apart. We'll see.

So context on that session, I know that we have all week to figure this out. I'm confident in us. So last week on like Wednesday or Thursday, Shiv and Janie were talking about how like the AI org isn't AI pilling enough. I think that is a term they made up. Like, I don't think that is a real term. Maybe it is. And they were like, everyone needs to AI pill and like commercial doesn't AI pill enough, which is untrue.

So then Shiv was like, let's make the entire CKO a commercial hackathon and cut all of the sessions, which I was on the conversation, but like, Michelle just pulled Jeremy on a huddle and we're like, so Shiv just said this and he goes, hell no. And then that was that. So it lasted all of five seconds. So to compromise, we were like, hey, no one really wants an entire executive panel because they're speaking all morning.

Let's make it be a showcase of people across the org using AI. And Jeremy's response was like, we'll show the entire org how to APIL better than the engineers can or something.

Yeah, I saw. I told you. I was like, great. Jeremy wants to do it out of spite now. to prove that commercial does indeed know how to AI pill. Well, let's don't ask the reps. They feel about buying groups first. That'll, that'll be a negative take on it, but yeah. Cool. No, that's, I'll say I'm, I'm joking. I'm great with all this. It's just like, I just want to like make sure I'm prepared is the big thing.

Yeah. Okay. So this session, I know I felt jokes in this morning, Chris, about like some of our loose ideas that we talked about last time. Yeah. I think I have our, our notion. I know takers running on this too. that note combined with the note before, which is cool. So... Let's start with the beginning portion. I know that I shared this with you, Chris, but I think we were thinking that like the first, I don't know, 15-ish minutes can be kind of like a combo of like Chris's Corner on like market trends.

I pulled this stat that I think was like healthcare humdrum this week on like even like 67% of clinicians right now are using AI daily, 90% weekly. So I think like. Any stats on where... revenue teams are typically at right now, and then also where our current stakeholders and partners are currently at with AI. Anything cool, Chris, I don't know, Claude bought stuff is crazy.

Like these over the weekend. Like, I think just like some, some interesting stuff like that to get people.

Well, I think it's kind of the spectrum of like, you're doing nothing and then you're already doing Claude bought. And it's like, we need to probably somewhere in the middle of that, you know?

Yeah.

Like, how do we kind of like responsibly use this? And I think that's what I would harp on too, is just like, there is a impact that could be negative to this. If we don't have some level of judiciousness to this, you know, as well.

Yeah. Yeah. I wonder if we could use like menti meat, or Kahoot or something, just to ask, what do you use it for? Yeah, and I think if it's a QR code, have them enter what you use it for.

Yeah. We're on, We're aiming for the end of the day today. So let's say realistically, probably tomorrow morning, we're going to send out the session registration so people can start picking sessions. So we should have a good idea to based on the size. Is it like 30 people and then we can keep it conversational? Is it like 70 people who signed up? Then, yeah, we can make a slide over like a meter or something for engagement.

And I think. Like in this 15 minutes, like, questions, some like 101. So I think we do like state of the market kind of stuff, state to state. Yeah. And then we go into like, this is from Joe, some of that like spec session we went to at enablement. But I liked some of these slides because like he separated it into three different sessions that you should run. But I think we could just instead separate on like three-ish slides on these topics.

First is like foundations of AI, which I think we can cover in like state of market, but just like... What is a large language model? What is like generative versus agent? Like some of that kind of stuff that people maybe know, maybe they don't know when they hear about it. And maybe we can ask them like, what are some stuff that you hear about that you don't know about? And like, it's a safe space kind of a deal.

And then I think prompting could be an interesting one at a high level, like who prompts and how do you do it? Like if you're Zach Anderson, right? Like we can make sure he's in the session and just like in the audience and call him out and be like, I see you just write like, "Write me a prep doc. Maybe if you wrote it this way, it would be better," type of a thing. Sure. Well, an idea that Speckit has in their deck that they talked about, which could be cool, is, like, an AI, like, Mad Libs to create a prompt, which could be kind of fun.

Yeah. I don't know how we would do that, or if it's just, like, maybe a dock that we have people, like... Yeah. Fell on a table for later, kind of like they do at weddings. Right. something fun like that. And then I think session three, what did they say? Is like our tech stack. So I think we can just replicate this type of a slide with our tech stack. Like what are the tools that you're using? And then what do they actually have at their disposal?

Because I think it's good for them to know context and like what you're using and what other people in the org are using, but they'll never have to touch.

I think on that note, I think like, because I've noticed you're using Claude now, right? You're not using Jachibiti. That's correct. And yeah, like I was talking to a friend yesterday, she was like, yeah, I switched over to Cloud because it's much better. But I had actually never heard of Cloud until you said it for the last few weeks.

Oh, really? I think that's the thing too. Cloud, in my opinion, is so much better for like work, professional stuff and like writing.

But do we have an enterprise?

So no, we don't. Yeah, I think that is coming. I think that is coming. I think so. We do have Cloud Code, which is like all these things have, you know, the front end, what we see, chat, dbt, those things. But also all these things have developer platforms too. Today, you can access Cloud Code via that developer license that we have. That's like, you know, effectively for like, and honestly, I use cloud code for everything.

I don't even like I use it for even like writing stuff. And I think that's the thing too, is like, we could kind of I think breaking the glass ceiling in between like, I'm not an engineer, I'm just an end user. And kind of like, how do we bend? In the right way, how do we bend people towards being like, you have to kind of like foundation start to have more of this like engineering mindset of like, this thing is not just for writing code.

It's also for others. And I think that's, I think there's stuff there too, potentially.

Yeah. I think an introduction into like, Chat TPT versus Claude versus perplexity and how a bridge offers access to these would be helpful too.

Yeah, for sure. Give IKEA warning. There might be a lot of requests for licenses.

Yeah.

I think that's a good thing. I think to me, when we start to see folks who don't use these things every day, use that. That's like a great inflection point that we should be paying attention to, you know, also.

Yeah. Like not, not to like age people, but just look at our average age of our like sales team. Like we are an AI company, so people might be using it, but I would not be surprised if there are people not using it.

Oh yeah, for sure. Okay.

And maybe terminology is good too, just to nail site, just to do some basic glossary type stuff too, like what does this mean?

Yeah, and I'm also curious, like, what does it actually mean to do vibe coding? Because, like, that's something I want to learn, but I don't even know where to start.

Like, would I do it on Claude? How would I start? Yeah.

Yeah, for sure. So this is not necessarily focused on And correct me if I'm wrong, how to... make AI meet me be a better commercial person. It's more like what is kind of the current lay of the land and AI and how do we kind of like give it a bend towards how I can apply some of these things in my day to day. Yes.

Okay. Yeah. I think this is like step one of probably like an entire year long program. Yeah. I know the whole org is going to do too is like, how can they use AI more? But I think this is like step one of getting them to even think about it.

And maybe how do we, how do we like start to use, how do I, what are we doing as a RevOps team to kind of like, pave that path as well for people also. Yeah. Yeah. Tactical question as far as formatting goes. Do you guys want me to build out slides? Like we'll... the formatting be kind of handled as far as how things should look or is that i guess like yeah we have we have this template here okay definitely can help you from a design perspective for all of this type of stuff um are they using our badge photo for the what are they using are photos being used at all like don't even give a photoUm, Mine's all better.

Yeah, I think we'll probably have that on there. We can also just do it's gonna so because it's gonna be in a breakout room also I think like whatever you want your walk-on music to be think about it And I think rather than it being walk-on music for you to be on stage What we'll do is have it play as people are entering the room as like their walk-on music just so it's not like Awkward and quiet and then we don't have to have a headshot.

We can just do like this is the title slide, too Okay I'll do it every other day. Because you're already going to be in the front of the room when people walk in. You know what I mean? Right. But we do need your walk-on music for... The other.

How would that work though? I could, if it's a multiple people, multiple people on the thing, whether this change as per person comes out.

For the one with... CK, like on the other one with everyone?

Yeah, well, you just let us play that. Wow.

Okay. So yeah. So what we're going to, that one's a little bit different because we're doing it like Apple keynote style. So Jeremy's going to have like the voice of God and he's going to stay on stage the entire time with a microphone and he's just going to be like, okay, next up. So no one's going to know who's coming besides Jeremy on stage. So it'd be like, okay, next up, Chris Humphries. And then we'll probably just have like five seconds of audio while you're just like coming to stage and your headshot probably on the main stage.

Okay. So do I need to provide a headshot or do y'all, One from we provided for badge photos.

If you have a preferred one, I probably would just use the badge photo one that has a white background.

Yeah, okay.

I'll get a better one. I feel like we all look weird with a white background. Yes, I'll get a better one. I'll get a better one.

Yeah, just send it over to me unless you want one.

Sorry for all my questions. I'm just making sure I'm doing this right.

Good question. Yeah, this one is a breakout.

It's a little bit more chill.

We don't need your headshot. It's not super formable. Make a conversational the whole shebang.

Okay, I feel like I have a good pathway to start kind of getting some content together on this.

Cool. Maybe we start with Like this is a stat, like maybe we start with like two or three stats or two or like one or maybe like one or two stats and then like one or two poll questions for the group. And then we can kick off into like this stuff, like industry terms, market news.

There's a concept, too, of kind of this echo chamber, too, of like, you know, I work in this stuff all day long. So I'm hearing things in a certain flavor and certain language versus even maybe what you guys are hearing. And then there's like then there's the next step. Like I'm a commercial developer. I'm focused on closing these deals. You know, I'm not really like what is how do we kind of like poke a hole through all those things to kind of like thread some common knowledge and context through it and kind of what's the Venn diagram there that kind of like where we all meet in the middle, you know, there.

Yeah.

Because to me, it's like that's where like, you know, if I'm Adam Korn and I'm about claude bot on social media and doing that then like but then i might hear about i'm like oh my gosh it's like a terrible thing no one should be doing this but then like he's like this sounds great it's like where do we meet in the middle on that and be like how do i think to me it's like how do you walk away more informed to kind of have a better pair of glasses to look at this stuff through you know from there Yeah.

Yeah. not calling out of course i just remembered his name from the session recently he may be a genius i don't knowOkay, cool. I'm going to start working on this today. This is my main goal for the kids to get all these things organized. But just generally at CKO, if I put stuff on the words here, marketing is going to kind of make it look better. Is that kind of the idea? Or is it?

Um... Potentially, if not, then I can help design, Jyotsna can help design. Marketing? Let's see how much the execs need help with their decks.

Yeah.

Yeah. How behind am I right now? I'm not being much of this stuff. Am I holding your head?

Okay. You're ahead of everyone. Okay.

Well, only thanks to you guys. I don't know anything. Okay, cool. Wow. Okay, so you'll let me know about the thing for the main stage deal today, tomorrow. Okay.

Yeah, we need the final agenda by today. I mean, it's like Monday before the event.

I know, I know. Are y'all coming in Sunday or Monday? I'm playing on Saturday. Wow. Are you going to the Super Bowl?

I'm going to try. I mean, I'm a Patriots fan, so.

Oh, wow. That's exciting.

Do you have tickets or no?

No, I set up like alerts if they drop under like $1,000, which is never going to happen. So...

Yeah, my best friend's a Seahawks fan, and I'm like, we should go early and go, but it would cost so much money.

There's so many free concerts, too, like Post Malone is playing for free, T-Pain's playing for free.

Where? Where?

I don't know. I haven't looked up where yet, but Hunter said like in SF itself, not necessarily like Santa Clara.

Oh, okay.

There's like a bunch of stuff going on in Union Square right where the hotel is too. You're doing like the live hot ones tasting with celebrities like in Union Square I think Sunday.

Oh, that's fun. I'll be there late though.

I'll be there at 945. Yeah, we'll get drinks at the hotel bar.

And then on Monday, that's the rehearsal. What rehearsal is that for?

So that rehearsal that I think I invited, did I invite you to one already?

Yes.

I think we can kill two birds with one stone for you and just do both of them at the same time. That one is technically for the one with Jeremy, Paula, all of them. But during that time, we can also do the tech check of this deck in there. And I can show you the breakout room because that one's going to be for the main stage and... production and all of their stuff, 'cause they're gonna have people in the back doing your slides there.

This one will be a lot easier.

And asking this question on behalf of, they asked me to ask you this. What is the dinner thing happening on Monday night? Is there, Brandon, can we also go dinner on our own if we wanted to or is that a requirement? What is the balance there? I don't think you should follow the rules.

Yes. Sorry, I'm making your life way harder. No, we were going to do team-based dinners and we were going to do like a RevOps dinner. One of the departments felt left out. So now we are randomizing everyone into groups and we are still trying to make the reservations 'cause it's the week of the Super Bowl and groups of 20 is impossible with the $35 dinner allowance that finances. No, I'm just venting, sorry.

No, no. This is so much pressure.

No, Annie and Lauren are working on it.

We're trying to get the invites out today, but you will have a dinner. Or the three of us can hide in a corner and eat dinner somewhere else.

That would be awesome, for sure. I told them I was talking to you. I wanted to ask what the context was. Yeah, it should be coming.

The EOPs are on it. They'll be randomized. I think you should be with at least one other person from RobOps.

I would rather just do a RobOps dinner, to be honest.

With the people that are there. Could we do that?

Riva felt left out, so now we had to randomize everyone. Reba's team spelt left out. They're eating dinner all the time together all the time it seems like.

Yeah, like honestly, like we don't get to meet as RevOps and I'd rather just like hang out with people that I actually wanna hang out with rather than random. I agree.

Maybe we can all just eat.

Yeah. It'll be fine. Hey, thank you all for everything you're doing.

These things are really hard to do.

Thank you all for all the work you're doing. I know it's hard. You're probably not getting told thank you that much. So thank you all for doing what you're doing. It's great. Thanks.

Yeah. Chris, did you guys get snow?

No, it's just cold here. We got, yeah, it's just like in the 20s and 30s.

Yeah, because we're like drowning with all the remote school days and the days off.

I guess you guys got snow. My brother's in Asheville. I've not talked to him yet.

Oh, yeah, we were in like a dry pocket, so we only got two inches. But like Asheville and Charlotte got like 12.

No, I need to talk to him. I haven't talked to him since the weekend, so I need to see. He's in Hendersonville. Oh, yeah.

So he probably got like eight or nine or something.

He lives in the woods, like kind of like... Kind of a little bit like preppery kind of thing. And so I'm hoping he's doing okay. We'll see. He'll be fine. They have a wood burning stove in their house, that kind of thing. They kind of keep it pretty, pretty crazy.

Oh, wow. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. He's got guns, that kind of thing. So we'll see. But yeah, I'm going to check on him. Not surprised Hendersonville in that kind of area has all that. Oh, yeah, for sure. Cool. Okay, guys, I'm excited. You're not going to seem nervous. It's going to be fun. So we'll figure it out. Yeah, we'll figure it out. All right. I'll see you. Okay. Bye. Bye. Bye.

# CKO Account Page Feedback

**Raw transcript**

The base calculator, extract the data that already exists, and create a base layer of like the thing. Oh yeah.

Yeah, I think finding ways, what's going into your calculator is happening, it's also being stored here.

Yes.

We can easily pull that in.

But then it links, so you can always find the link to their ROI calculator.

And then we take the file that you generate and store that in Salesforce. Correct.

'Cause that'd be good, 'cause the thing that, I know that it hurt us early feedback is PX want to be able to get a handoff doc of what is said and do that at scale seamlessly.

So if that can help that.

Yeah, but I'm saying if we could also store it in Salesforce, that'd be even better. All right, sorry, Chris, keep going. The thing that the Notion AI took or missed was that on the Ask AI chatbot section, you should be able to do dictation type style and then also be able to command to update fields. Perfect.

So kind of going down, we'll go here first. Just like starting to surface key moments in an interesting way or the timeline view.

So that's the key moments thing, Andy, and others that I've been talking about for like six months is something I envisioned to be like both Robin events, key moments and things. I think there's a CTA there that could be happened to like add something. It should be like AI generated key moment, like suggested key moments. Like, hey, a competitor was mentioned here. Add is a key moment. Hey, you're a champion.

You said you're the champion left like add as a brought in event whatever it could be or like it surface like it like an article or something correct or you can manually add something like hey this is just happened like whatever happened and yeah, that could be an interesting thing to go to circle overlay the other thing with key moments. Sorry, you're good. You're good. The other thing with key moments I expect that'd be really cool would be track like actually tracking the role action execution.

So when role actions, if you already have get executed It goes and puts it on that timeline so we can see like, hey, they had their demo here. We can kind of see this thing and kind of see easily. Where it is in a cycle?

Yeah. Do we categorize that with attention?

Attention already has it. Okay. So attention has all of the kind of.

They have all the call type mapping.

Correct. We just have to pull that in. Okay. We never did.

What were the ones we were working on?

We might need to update it, but even like that, it's like they had an ROI call. Because then for me, there's like key moments. I've been sites are just like one's laughing to see the road map when's the last time I call you can start to look for these like ones when you connect that to the event and the Conversation so you fully can see that the key moment, but also there's an event artifact and you go in and see it It's like it connects that basically there's a conversation And then there's opportunities to like rate back like was it a good that's the attachment wasn't out what questions were they asked during?

PX around like the playbook. Yeah, I have a book just to make sure that we're aligned because it should theoretically push back Executed or whatever it should push back as a key moment or something whatever I want exactly or like yeah or if there's overlap like when you think if someone goes through and plan hat and fault and put and follows that playbook that Like those activities are completely correct.

We need to make sure those push back because that allows us to win the fall Yep, we have pricing tears down here as well. So I just kind of visualize that in a cleaner way Right now, I understand that stuff. So that's kind of the left bar and this is all it could change. I mean, over time as well too. Wait, are those like their actual pricing tier? Would those be like their actual pricing tiers? Or this is just like an example of pricing?

I think it's their actual pricing tier. On the next steps one, if you scroll up, that next step should be like next steps in upcoming meetings. So you can kind of see what any tasks were in these upcoming meetings. And it's easy for you to like see And that can also not connect to the buying group because you can have little signals in which you are involved right right? Yep I mean it's really we were reflecting before our sales forces in the last 15 years made only two to their UI really classic and The only things I've ever changed yeah, this is like we're just writing though, and we've reimagined completely the experience And there's still things like great opportunity.

We have to bring some table-stay stuff over that's like All the buttons.

Yeah, but you have all those. You've already built those flows.

Yeah, I'm going to type into this directly there.

All right. Keep going.

And then kind of centralized here is kind of some context sections. We have like external signals. So what we've been capturing in the news, we're storing those here. So we're going to categorize some there. So. Solution consulting, so kind of what's been happening on the solutions front right now is there. Implementations, there it is. Implementations, kind of what's happened there, status, so quickly to understand what context happened across these different implementation records.

And lastly, just the active account plan that's going on there.

I think there's more we can do with that account plan. Like tab, I don't know. I think something that we just need to think through, and we know we need to migrate the account plan object, It's like what is the experience that account planning should have because it could be a cool thing right actually that it starts like The problem I have with account planning is it's helpful but it like is so like static and the momentum that it creates afterwards.

It's like what is the result or outcome that we hope to drive the result of the account plan? It's like here's the account plan at the time of review and then here's the account game plan that I would love for it to like help drive.

We're building the objectives right as well too.

So it's like either like objectives and I think there's some stuff that plan has. The conversation we need to have with CKO is just about what that ecosystem looks like.

We can probably drive that back from the conversation. What objective did this company touch on?

What is the customer's goals and objectives that we want to track and ratify? But then what are our goals and objectives with them and what we want to do? It's like, okay, our goals with this account are to get them to this MRU level, this opportunity expansion or whatever, and just be really clear on that.

So that's kind of just context there. Moving down here into buying groups, that's kind of, The same, we're adding in this engagement. I like this. Score two, so this is kind of a way to really jump in and see. Kind of idea of my breath frequency and depth like how are we looking across this as well? I think that's nice because that gives them like actual insight not just a completion Yeah, here's where you're missing yet, and I think yeah, it's basically kind of like we've got two different kinds of scoring mechanism Yeah, well I know those those are those just a question like for some like smaller enterprise especially commercial where Which is okay.

And that's where they feel like they're being kind of dinged on it because the scores are going to be lower.

I think we just need to index based on the segment, which is commercial only needs. We did have that.

But we've also said that we're only doing it for 250 doctors or above, which all of them will have. And I also think, too, there's a discussion of like, for my deal, this only has a CMO and a CIO, but not these. So we need to avoid custom. Yeah, we can't get into custom buying.

No, I don't think so. It is what it is. The data is the data, and then we have to benchmark based on that.

It's not just like building the buying group for this one reason. It's also downstream to other things. Yeah. This is kind of coming in as well. It's like we're kind of bringing in some health scoring to them. I mean, I wouldn't say like N88 is a good score. This is pretty fresh right now.

Yeah, I think we need to rephrase how we...

So that would kind of run on a schedule. It's as large and the same as it is today.

I think there's an opportunity with the buying groups here to get even more compact. There's a lot of white space on that, where I'm wondering, Can we actually, do we need it to be double length in the, that or if we like scoot?

I mean, we tested putting it like over here.

But even just like scooting the, those activity stuff right there, like above. Yeah. And then have the activity thing be a smaller icon or like a smaller CTA.

And this does shrink pretty well nicely on the side.

Yeah, we should take a look to see what happens. We tested that earlier and it did okay with that.

So I think that could be an opportunity there. They also have tabs here which is kind of cool. It shows the different buying group members. As opposed to having a tab per buying group, it's more like that. Amen.

Can you click into the activity? There's so much opportunity in the screen. Yeah, totally. Because the one question that came up that I thought was also a good piece of feedback is let's just say this has like you have like 40 emails with this person. I think by default it only pulls in the first 10 or whatever for the list. If you could like click it, if that email's parenthesis was clickable, you could just like pop up a filtered list of those activities.

You could look at like marketing.

Or yeah, like something where it's like a show lasts 30 days. Right, right. Only important ones or whatever.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. Make that a little bit more interact, yeah, like interact.

I also think there's an opportunity on this screen to show more insight about the person. It's like, hey, this person is showing they engaged recently. What do we know about them or anything else? Yeah, what is your particular thing? Pull from any insights that have existed, like build something in terms of their, what signals we have on them.

There's a lot of jobs that are in the background that are doing these things with people and kind of servicing them now. Yeah, 'cause I think there's this opportunity to It's a really good real estate there that yeah Interactive is the word I meant to say not interactive And then we got this new kind of project team view that kind of like really that the solve here is trying to solve managing your project teams at scale, you know, we also have a lot of like Swirl and thrash around status page as far as how that should be best done.

We made a big change I think we stood it didn't nail it quite yet inside think like this basically integrates with size page if they check these boxes I think in the long term she handled by the product. We're not there quite yet. And that's we're doing it here right now But basically like there's a way Like they can kind of check what they're doing or unsubscribe as well from these two So basically they can kind of easily subscribe to that from there because they right now it looks like this and then update multiple fields within the contact.

It's going to save them a ton of time. And Hannah Stover with the buyer product feedback, I think gets into the place where it is. Chris, do you mean to go to the office?

Yeah. I've never been before. Is it nearby? I have no idea where we are.

It'd probably take... 20 minutes to Uber there.

I'll come back.

Well, it's just like it's like straight across downtown.

I think it's fine.

Yeah. We're almost there.

Okay.

But yeah, so we got feedback from Hannah just now on this.

That's so slow. It's really bad. Can we use the secret wifi for the builders? Huh? Yeah, we could. We should use the secret wifi for the builders.

Oh, it was posted. Hey, there was actually a car here with the...

I'm on this one.

I don't know what the builder's wifi is. Let me try the lobby again. Was there a special? -Everybody, we're going to update in ten more minutes.

So, be documented and then we'll wrap up and call the groups to stay. So, in ten more minutes. But anyways, I think we're back now for a second. Basically, we got feedback from Hannah. I also want to add the ability to bulk update and manage. Look at all my people that are subscribed. How do I manage all of them in one fell swoop? So that's not here yet. We'll add that in. From there, they can also manage their topics this way too that they're using also from there.

Um... And then yeah, a way to add members as well too, in bulk.

To reduce clicks, it might be easier if that just is, I don't know if it's hard, easier, but it might be the topics, if it was also checkbox.

So right now it's a multi-select on the back end.

Yeah, but I wonder if you can, it's a multi-select on the back end, but I wonder how the front end, just click versus having to like, Probably could. It would be easier for each one.

What's the super secret with builder Wi-Fi? Because they're not using it anymore. We could only do it for each. I have no idea. It's not on Slack, actually. No.

All right, now let's get into the cool thing.

Are you on our regular Wi-Fi or are you on your Western?

I'm on the meeting rooms. This is to me is the section that's most revolutionary about what we can actually do, which takes everyone out of Slack and doing all those other things and links up to what Ramon and Zach are building too. Chris, you can kind of take it away.

So basically a way just to like bring what are the key, and these can be fluid and flexible, what are the key and like customize per role too. But like what are the things that you're kind of leaving this to go do?

Is this the New York Hackathon AI?

Yeah, basically. Basically a way to like draft an email you want to send right there. You can populate that. This is all like dummy data right now, but a way to draft an email that you want to send and you can add more to kind of customize that.

This is one that's cool. Eventually we should have toggles for like what you want to do. Is it a cold where you're probably trying to decide what you want to do with it?

Yeah, absolutely. Meeting prep, clean idea. This way is effectively like use attention and stuff to kind of generate these quick documents. So we went through how to like make these into artifacts too. How can I refer to this later? So that'll be stored. as well too.

I wonder if we need a related list that has documents or something. Maybe we can use files.

Yeah, something like that. Every time I generate one, make it just a file that's somewhere stored.

Or you can make a drop-down of your upcoming tasks and then select it, then it'll just push straight to the details.

The other thing here that could be helpful, depending on where we go, is create this in a Google Doc and just have it automatically create the Google Doc.

Yeah, absolutely. A lot of the same kind of thing. This is Brad's ROI. Link out to that. An exec summary doc as well. Just needs some work. But I want to generate that also too.

But like to me there's like other... I'll keep going. Yeah.

And so we've got sales handoff, dock as well as a handoff of sales. So these are all just like kind of placeholders right now. The way is just to quickly generate these things and then create things to hand off from there. Got a close loss analysis. Also, right now it's very much generic data. Right now it looks bad. All right. We can figure out what y'all are doing, kind of find a way to bring that in as well to some degree, I think too.

To me, this is a great thing where it's like to go close loss, you have to click this thing and it goes through and then ask them, based on what information exists, they can ask them more detailed questions that you would want to do and basically be able to facilitate what ends up happening.

So should I stop working with attention on updating myself?

Well, we're using, attention is going to expose their APIs.

Instead of having to have to go through Slack or anything else, we can just have it. The call mapping stuff, what you're saying, right? Like the call tracking with Hintzein, or what are you talking about? Well, no, 'cause I was just gonna have them, 'cause right now I go into their agent and get all the details that I need to prep for the calls that I have.

We could run that.

We could run that from here, yeah. Yeah, and then...

Yeah, I'd rather do that.

And ultimately it's still... It's the same data.

I know we were talking about templatizing closed-loss retros on every new logo.

If we could templatize, here's the stuff that we know already, here's the missing stuff. Is this correct? Read through it. And then resource requesting, I think, is where...

Yeah, so we can hook it into the flow of your building right here and find... We can even add some more stuff on top of it too. And I actually kick off those requests, come here and store those also.

To me, I almost feel like there's an opportunity for hitting that button and it brings up a modal of the different resources available at that particular time. It's like, okay, do you need to ask for implementation resources to do whatever? And you can just click and then it takes you to the next phase. Yeah, absolutely. Like almost like a given icons pop up. For sure.

And then links just to some resources so we can find ways to map things to dashboards.

The Google Drive folder thing I really like.

Google Drive as well. That's right. On that. Sigma link out too.

I like the paid, the invoice status.

The invoice status is pretty sick too. Yeah. That's real.

Yeah.

The dollars are wrong, but we're getting, we're mapping, but yeah. And also contracts too.

Yeah. I mean like that's the thing is like any rep who's experienced a clawback before is gonna love this.

They're gonna be able to see it immediately. Yeah. And we can even make it way more... In terms of like, as we start to move up more upstream, and Chris and I have been talking about this last week, it's like we're earning the right to go further and further. The building blocks enabled us to now reimagine the count page, and then by extension, I think we can then normalize the other sub-objects from this.

I think the way that we're approaching this applies to opportunities and things, so the parents mostly.

And the goal is to make this as reusable as we can, so if we go to opportunity, we can say what pieces of that we want to use.

And that's what I think it is, because maybe the side panels, some of these side panels persist or whatever, but then eventually go into, The ref command center they actually approach and shows things that are going to pop up. And we just ask when.

So that's how it stands today.

Is it you or just Chris? He asked me, but I was just asking.

Okay. What? Chris, you're talking to him. Oh, I know. You have your discussion. Exactly. I'm sorry.

But yes, so basically that's how it stands as it is right now. And we got, you know, like moving, we'll move key fields. This is messy as hell right now.

Yeah, but like some of the key fields that exist on the account page are nice.

This is all a bunch of gross shit there right now, but we can figure that out. So just finding ways to...

A couple other ideas that I have is the green dot thing that we have at the top where it's the health. Yeah. How is Plan Hat doing scoring? Are they doing scoring? We haven't really gotten into it. Okay, but that's another opportunity where we can have that actually be something that you click and it shows why it's that way.

What we learned actually last week was that we cannot bring the...

We said we can't. Oh, okay. That we can't map the emojis over? Yeah.

No, they figured it out. They figured that out, okay, sweet.

But I think we're playing at as well as like,Time period data, growth over time.

Yeah, maybe we bring that in. So like there's actually big drinks in it. Maybe we bring that in, but another idea that I have is to try to wireframe or iframe some of the Sigma data over time. So if you click it, you can see the base.

Yeah, that would work too because I think you can just use query parameters to feed. Yes.

It's like, okay, here's showing the usage over time. So you click on Account Summary.

You can see what their MRU consumption looks like over time.

Correct. You could be like, here's your work ID. equals question mark, or whatever you want to call it.

And then I don't just show it. The only issue there always is authentication.

You like to log in and follow them.

But then if you're looking at this page where you see how many licenses they have, then you can see that line. And then I'm like, all right, this is where I am in the list, and that's 70% target.

What time is your session tomorrow, Chris? I don't know.

I think it's after lunch.

The thing that I'm most excited, we've even gotten to the afternoon section, but I think this right hand panel where you can actually start to do actual actions is what the freaking Salesforce action market was supposed to be so many years ago. Because I can change and--Yeah, yeah.

So there's a lot that has to happen to get here as far as like on the back end of this. I think we can start to like pick up building blocks.

Yeah, I wonder which of these do you feel, I mean, so we got, like which of these do you feel like we can start to...

Private teams is almost ready.

A lot of teams you can hopefully be ready tomorrow. Yeah. The top icon I think is also very helpful.

Like all of that is very helpful. Like that section right there is easy.

That's easy, yeah. I think the... The layout that you have right now, the account plan implementation, so it's consulting external signals, and if we nail key fields, also feels like very...

It's just like a cover.

Exactly. Pick the stuff that makes it like a visual uplift, and then we can start to bring in that side panel.

That's the one that probably takes the most, because I want to really build a way in trade to really route, because I need attention to help here, too.

Yes, and that's the next thing. And make it really fast. It can't be slow. But to me, I think the first thing is resource requests. Yes. And then how we can add the AI layer, 'cause I feel like that is even really nice if we were to make that more of an actual experience where you click it again, like, you know, Total pops up.

There's different icons within things that you could do and you click it Chris we also just put last 30 days and our use I think that's supposed to be on there and I think I was doing this like on the airport What the hell But no, I think anything that's like visual and more just like a better way of seeing it, we can do quickly. That's the biggest kind of like plumbing we have to route. But also, I think it'll be okay once we start to kind of figure out the pattern for it.

We also have last 38 encounters as well.

Yeah, last 38 encounters are even that. But the other thing I thought would just be like right now I'm going to Slack and they want a lot of clinician feedback or anything else. They could just go to the account that's already in Salesforce and click something and they can start to attach the right things if they wanted to if that was easier. I don't know.

We'd have to ask what people prefer. Well, the other thing that we've been talking about too is like with attention, We don't want to flood it with every single thing anyone's ever said, but it's like if you get off a particularly salient call, how do we surface that? We can actually say, "Hey, you have a cleanup." Yeah, exactly.

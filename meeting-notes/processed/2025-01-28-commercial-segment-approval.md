Hey Chris, how's it going?

Good, how are you? Good. Good. Sorry, I just have another call. Let me get myself organized for this one. Yeah, no problem.

Did you have the plan hat meeting today?

Yes, we're actually, I'm actually at the delayed offices. That was where the conference was. Okay, nice.

Thanks for coming on. You might have that conflict, but thanks for...

Hopping in. Now I'm... Excited. Let's see, okay.

How's New York? Has it gone out at all? It's still pretty cold.

It's still pretty cold. There's still a bunch of the snow on the ground. Michelle and I walked here from the New York office. It was like a 10, 15 minute walk, but it's like, you're still kind of trudging through some snow. Yeah, yeah. The roads are mostly cleared?

down and out yeah and it's definitely very cold but it's like there's no snow or anything like that we don't have any did you get any like we got freezing definitely it's like it's definitely below freezing still right now but it's there's no we didn't have like enough weather to have ice or anything i think nashville right above us got nailed the hardest yeah nashville seems like nashville got kind of the worst of it like yeah yeah like everywhere else was able to handle this snow all right right They got a lot of ice, which I think is...

The worst possible outcome in those scenarios. Because it's so heavy. It just screws everything up. I would take two feet of snow over ice, I think. Totally. And we got a lot in this meeting. Thank you.

Zach, I guess. We're going to stay before Taylor's here. But is the spreadsheet she gave you, the beautiful spreadsheet she gave you, is that enough to update... All the contacts are joining to do something else.

I think we can cascade all this. We'll talk about it in the second part.

I'll be patient. Nick will set up all the automation, then we'll drop that in. And then that's it. I'll wait my turn.

Chris doesn't really know about that part, so we're going to tell him. Okay.

But we love a bullcrap boy.

Yeah, they're great. I've already done three today. That's fine. No problem.

One. One big one.

Cool. So this is all about the... The task around set commercial segment approval is the PS standard PS model things like that so I know you'd like all the Around and I'm gonna share my screen just we kind of can orient better here But effectively– okay, there we are. all around kind of this opportunity and go to an account Um, around this idea of like these two new model fields here now. So we have these fields in place and then the supporting on them.

A little, Chris. Sorry.

So We have these fields and the kind of the supporting automation in place that basically allows for, you know, there's kind of that, logic you just find in the Asana task that allows for how to kind of like lay this out. So these are all in place and working now as far as the segmental segment stuff goes. And then I think on top of that was the approval process as well. And so do y'all feel good about what's on the account side, like noting how this is working quite yet or do you want to review that too?

Well, we'd--There we go. Probably gonna say the same thing.

Chris, you and I had talked about triggering, I think off of OPCA, creation. Yeah. Let me look at my stuff here. Yeah. I don't know if we did that yet, but that was the one thing we needed. I know you set off for the opportunity status, right?

Yes, same idea.

I got that. That's in place now.

OK, so that'll upstream now.

OK, cool. Proceed.

Yes. All good. Let me get to my... Sorry.

Okay, here we go. I'm just looking at the logic automation. Yeah, so basically, we would update this field. when account status has changed and it changes to customer, pilot, or open opportunity. So any one of those three changes would cause us to go and run the logic against these fields. Um, From there, we are going to check position count to basically to make decisions on what happens from there.

So we're looking at effectively those ranges of 0 to 10 or blank, which nothing would happen 10 to 100 and then 100 to 350 are the ranges we're kind of running against right now. on that front. And then once we check those things, Excuse me. When I zoomed in on my screen got really big. Here we go. Okay. We're checking also basically for like the integrations as well. And so checking is there any active integrations on the account, looking at different versions of that.

And then we basically would set these two fields based on that logic there too. So does that all feel correct to you guys? Yes.

The only, well, Zach may have more like true logistical questions. My only one that I worry about is that, so that essentially means new ones will get this auto set. What about ones that exist today? So like if they move in the sales stage, will we then trigger it?

Yeah. We probably need to probably be some degree of backfill. I think it probably closes the gap on this.

We may want to identify what that might look like and fill in the gaps there today.

And I can just run that. I can identify that and run it through this in the same way from there.

That makes sense. That's a cleanup.

Yeah. Yeah, this basically now is like, this has been on for a couple of days, I think, at this point in time. And so anything that's happened since then, it should be starting to work with.

But it's definitely a gap we probably need to fill from there. The only... thing I guess to point out there is if we're the initial triggers on open op, we may not have an integration value yet. Um, For some of the defining elements. I mean, it would get picked up eventually.

Yeah, that is true. And it'll definitely get picked up eventually. I think our largest priority is physician count. And later, it will get the integration. Yeah. It'll get the integration updated. One thing that we might have to do to like foolproof this is Lena is to enable solution consulting to ensure the integration gets updated and then to even validate this, knowing that commercial is starting to do solution design, which will help to.

Right, right, right. That's kind of like my thought that the framework makes sense, but you do have to have people fill it out and we'll have to leverage solution consulting to accurately get the integration in there if we want to use it as a change.

And the way it stands today basically is we're only would run this automation based on that status field changing. So if nothing else, like that is the driver. So we wouldn't need to think about a wider, a wider kind of driver. We'll want to consider that too, as far as like, but that I would take that field happening. On the integration side, if right now, if there's no integration value for that 10 to 100 slot, we would not set the field at all.

So it wasn't an innovation that exists.

So we may want to think about that. We probably want to default that, right? Okay, we can talk about that, Chris, tomorrow. Like punch, poke some holes and stuff like that. Yeah, yeah. Cool.

But outside of that, this is running on... I'm sorry, go ahead.

I'm going way behind. I'm going back to the beginning here. What feels... What are we liking that? I'm trying to zoom in.

He says I am model and PS model under the clinical success model.

I couldn't see it. I couldn't see it.

Chris has super eyes. I'm on a big screen, so everything looks smaller, I think. Okay.

And so... Taylor, does it make sense? I don't know if we talked about this before. Like, does it make sense for this to happen? update on any existing partners. We already have...

We are, because we're on existing apps, we are implementing them as grouped. And like, you'll want to... still have the people do a commercial piece Yes, model and some right.

Yeah. Yeah. I guess. Right. Like we don't, it's not, it's not something that we need to do. Right away. But like for some existing ones where we're like, oh, now they meet the threshold for like.

Oh, when I said existing, I meant open opportunities that have not closed yet. That's a good level of, I think, for me to be clear on what I meant. For existing partners, we can probably handle that. Yeah. Yes. Okay. Different world.

Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Great. I'm caught up. I feel good about this.

Sounds like a great bulk upload opportunity. For sure. Yeah, absolutely.

We know the man for the job. The people.

Great. So we do all feel aligned on this piece of the puzzle here. Okay, there's definitely things, there's some logic we'll think through. On top of that, I'm going to zoom out so I can see on my end, there's the approval process for someone wants to go to a standard PS model. and then also the approval process for someone who wants to sell a deal that has less than 10 physicians. So we have two approval kind of like branches for that.

So we have that built as well, kind of how that'll work. So I'll give you all a demo of those two pieces and then we can talk from there if that works. Okay, great. Um Let me get down to a good deal here. So I'm writing this on task so it makes sense here. Basically, what we'll have now is a button that lives here called request approval. We also have validation in place that basically says like if someone goes and sets that field to standard or if we're in that position count range and they're trying to progress the deal forward past like the align stage, we would say, hey, you meet one of these two criterias for approval.

And so they will be then pushed. They can edit things.

They can't change stages until they go and do this thing.

set up to a certain degree. When they do that, and that happens, they'll click this button here, and it will detect which situation that they're in. A question I did have is, is there ever a situation where both are true? Like it could be a standard PS model and less than 10 physicians. Or is that, are those usually exclusive?

Standard PS?

For less than 10.

For less than 10.

Probably not.

I don't think so.

It shouldn't be. Like, let's not. I could say there could be like one in a million.

Okay, so they're different use cases. It's likely different because basically it kind of looks at both and then makes a decision and then moves forward.

If you're asking for both of those approvals for an opportunity, like I need to meet in person and for you to give me like a PowerPoint.

That's like turning a plane right. Okay, got it. Yeah. Okay.

We've had two of them and that's because they're Zach's special, not the Zach, Zach our CTO. But we lost both of the seals after.

Okay. Should we have? Cool. So when they say we'll do small deal then we'll go back into the other one. Basically this is gonna call it out. I click the button, it recognizes the use case and then they'll submit that request. They'll do that here. It'll go kick this off and I'll show you what happens from there and give it a second to... So it submits the request, they're good. What we have now on the opportunity is kind of this approval request object now.

And so basically that's gonna capture in this history. I think it's important that we kind of can have an audit trail of what happened for these approvals. So these are some test ones I've done in the past. You can ignore those. But basically it kicks off and creates one of these guys here that looks like this. So this is basically an approval record that they've requested, if that makes sense. So that's like the Salesforce side.

Let me pull in Slack. and show that to you. What happens in Slack is this gets sent here. So this would go to this message effectively would go to, we need to define a channel or define how we want to do this, but it would go in there and we're pinging Amir and Jeremy to one of them has to click approve on this request, if that makes sense. So, Everybody okay so far?

Yeah, sorry. Is this a DM or is this in a channel?

I think it probably makes sense to have a shared channel because that way it's kind of centralized and not being lost in DMs from there. Yeah, I love it. Okay, cool. And you can do a...

We could also give them a queue in Salesforce. This is us trying to make this easy, but that paper trail object.

What we did for like, you did this for me, for Chris for staffing requests is he did both. So he like sends the thing, the notification to like my implementation leads channel, but then there's also a queue so you can go back and actually--We have the same thing there.

It's all good. So once they click approve or reject, There. That broke, I don't know. Maybe I'll just try it again. There we go, cool. I'll see what happened there. They have a way to type in some notes on the approval if they want them. So, you know, they can type in notes on there just for the context. When it's saved, that then is going to go lock up that approval request now to where they can't go back to that.

It's been approved, right? And then now it's going to go around and there's a level two approval for REBA at that point in time. So this will come in in a second. It'll kick another one of these messages into this channel or shared channel where she would do the same thing effectively. and the sheet approve or reject it and go from there. So that's the approval flow. Yeah, there it is now. So now level two of two requires her approval from there.

And she would do the same thing on that front. Um, So I'll just do that for, and I'll show you the Salesforce side too.

We're thinking that this is all in the same channel for visibility. I think so, yeah.

Because of the trail there, you can see those things too, which is good. We can add more context there. On the Salesforce side, what's happened is we've now filled out this with like basically what's come through for that. So now we have like who approved it when, you know, and like what notes they gave there. And then now this deal can progress forward at that point in time from there. Thanks.

We should probably get something back to the requester.

Yeah, we should for sure. Yeah.

Yeah, just so they know. Okay, cool. Yeah.

You also should. And then, so say they reject it, right? So they go through, that would probably then be, when you think about that flow, like that's probably a new approval request at that point in time. I would say if it's rejected, it kind of lays there and then I'd want them to start this again, basically to get that approval, if that makes sense. So that way we have that, those two distinctions on that.

So someone can't go like revive a new request. No one can delete them. Like they're all, this is all, this is basically an audit trail for this. So we just know, cause I mean, I've just seen this happen before where no one knows what happened.

And then it's like, what's the point of this anyways? So.

So the flow is very much the same for the, I'll set this just to show you for the standard one. It's very much the same flow. except for the differences that would go to Megan Sims and Madeline to approve at that point in time. So now if that field's set, it's going to then say... you know, this and ask them, why are you requesting this basically for this situation? And then these are the two options you guys gave me.

I don't know what they mean, but I did put them in the pick list. And so they're there. We can change it however we want it to be from that front. And then it would submit that request as well in the same way. So then over here we have, when it shows up, the same idea here on that front also. So does that kind of land? Go ahead, sorry.

No, Madeline, you speak first.

Yeah, can you go back? What's the... At what point are they... asking for approval on this one.

At this point, it's the same. I don't know. I guess I have my knowledge gap. It was what's happening to get there in the first place. That's what I'm thinking.

If nothing is prompting for this one, that would be an easy one. It would also lock them up too.

The validation is there as well too though.

They can't take the deal past... Stage three. That'll prompt pretty quickly. Okay, so can you describe the...

the criteria for this again, like what needs to be true and the opportunity for them to have to Yeah, so if they go to this field on the account, And I guess they set that field to standard right now. And then they go to the opportunity that's connected. That's what's going to lock it up.

Got it. I think that's what I'm thinking that they just like won't do because they're not thinking about that will take enablement.

What drives them to set this field here I guess is probably the right question.

I mean they've never had the field before.

Right.

So wouldn't this be... Automated as part of the first part, Chris. So it would be and it would be a different value, right? It'd be grouped. Yeah. Right. So I kind of wonder if they don't have to do anything and they just go make the request. And then the approval process changes it to. Standard. If it's approved.

That's fine. They'll have to basically be enabled on it. They have to go do that. Exactly. Totally. Oh, yeah.

They have to know. Yeah, they'll have to know like default for this is going to be grouped. Here's how you can see that it's grouped if there is an exception. Yeah. Yeah.

But mechanically, it would operate in the same way from there.

Got it. But the other one is like... they will be blocked by something that they're trying, like they're not, they're going to be blocked by just like the nature of the deal, which is the total position count being less than zero. Right. Bye. Okay. I gotcha. Makes sense to me. Thank you. Okay.

So I think my question, I can make that change. That's fine. You know, I think from there, what does enablement look like for this stuff? How do I make sure that both the end users and leadership is in the right position to know they're going to get in these requests and that sort of thing too.

And then actually my only ask is for IAM model for it to be similar. Like if people are asking to change the IAM model for it to come to me in Evan. So I actually feel like if I'm thinking about this, it's actually far more likely that they're going to ask to change the IAM model than the PS model, because they're going to say, can I get a dedicated pilot? And sure, we'll do like a, we'll do the commercial partner success.

Doing a similar flow for IAM model as well.

Yeah. Perfect. Exactly. And actually, I think the reasons are the exact same too. Like literally it's just a copy paste. Okay. That's fine.

Now, these are the only two things we can ever build for an approval model because I can see everybody's gears turning.

Yes. What else can we approve?

Well, I think it is an immense amount of overhead. So to your point, we don't want to silo this with people. But I do think that this will be helpful because this is happening today, but it's happening in Slack DMs. back.

Yeah, that was my big thing.

It was like trackability is really important here. Exactly. Like the honest answer is we shouldn't create a process to approve things, but this is helpful when this was already happening, but it had no process.

I'm being somewhat facetious. I know, but you are right.

I know there's going to be 15 of these in two months.

Yeah, I know. We have a framework now we can work with.

That's so slick.

'Cause you know what we all need? Actually more Slack workflows. Yeah, we need more.

Yeah, we don't have to use Slack. That's what we're gonna say. We're gonna be like, this is your choice. You can bookmark this page in Salesforce. Okay, recap. Chris and I will look at a few of the like edge cases slash poke holes and things. we need to Use the approval logic. to set fields if it's approved because i don't think somebody's going to go back and change it or we can just get that off for them make it easier we need to enable this so we probably need to get with geodesna and i assume it only really impacts the commercial team and maybe enterprise ever so slightly but i i even then i don't think so um And then I think we can...

publish at some point yes we should also tell Annie Lawson and Carrie Poland where the queues are so they can watch those we could just tag them that could be very effective maybe no we can start tagging Jeremy and Amir but I do think that we should figure out get it all in one channel for them I can build that that's fine And Taylor, who's in this, like, who do you think is in this channel? So this is actually what I, I kind of started DMing you.

I have, I want, you and I can take this back actually. Yeah.

I think it's for us to figure out.

And then we'll come back to you. We've got a few things to think through. Okay.

We're going to put it in random.

Yeah. We'll actually cycle in new people all the time.

I will never find it.

Yeah. This is incredible, Chris. I really appreciate it. There's like a lot of friction today, both in like how we serve our partners. And there's like a lot of friction between people today because there's just so much hot potato. So like, I'm really excited to see how that'll solve some of the problems for them.

Well, I'm glad it helps for sure. Uh, timeline wise, we wouldn't know when he kind of went, it was like a pre CKO post CKO thing. What do y'all think as far as all of the things that happened to get this live? Post. Post, okay. Cool. Okay, cool. That's fine. We'll work toward it.

And Amir and Jeremy pre-looped in.

Like I've talked to Jeremy a little bit about it, but more on the actual Slack structure than-I think we should do like a Loom video for Reba, Amir, and Jeremy and say, welcome to this channel in which you will be doing this. They all know conceptually it's coming. But we should remind them that this is coming. Cool.

Okay, yeah, I agree. Okay, great. Let's talk real quickly, our Nebula list. I don't even think we need to share screens anyway. Just speak to us. Taylor put together a wonderful account-based list for a bulk upload. It has all the current customers that would fall into that bucket. Chris, I can share that with you. The second part, and probably equally important, is... Taylor is currently for backfill purposes going through and checking individually contacts for status page values that need to be in the Nebula project or whatever it's called.

And so, yeah. What we were thinking is there's like twofold triggers potentially. One being on the implementation record, the Nebula integration can be identified and then certainly at the account level that can be identified. So, When that happens, either or, we would look at all contacts with a, what is it, a Product status notification, I think, is the nomenclature. Whichever one.

Yeah. Yeah.

The problem, the only issue I had there, Chris, was like, I don't think they're, are they still using that?

Or has it all gone down? I mean, it's not yet.

So I kind of wonder if we need to go like, if you have an active checkbox for any, like Status page notification also check the net. Exactly. Exactly. Sure. That's right. Yeah, we can do that. Okay. So that has to happen first. And then once you push the bulk upload in, it should catch all of that and upload, update them all at once.

I probably honestly would do. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, yeah, that's fine.

Yep. Do you have any concerns with like overloading the status page API all at once?

Potentially, but we can figure that out. Worst case scenario. I mean, I can get, I can also buckle that into status page too if we have to. No. Yeah. So we have options for that for sure.

Okay. So just reiterating, all of the contacts who have any of Bye. status notifications checked that are included in the list that $1. we'll get added to the Nebula. We'll get the Nebula checkbox.

Right. And then ongoing, if someone sets one of those two values there, we would then go do the same exercise for that entire account, right? Like we would check and see who has one checked. Exactly. Okay, cool.

Exactly. But going forward, I think that has to still be managed manually.

Yes, we know. We will re-educate the people, systems, and processes.

Is the new process working okay? Like, is it, the checkboxes, is that overall effective and helpful? Or is it not good?

I mean, I think it's fine. I think what we're running into is like, especially like there are org level settings, right? Like Nebula is an org level. Sure. setting. And so like what happened is we have this nebula incident on Saturday and people just didn't like people weren't enabled and forgot. And so like, and it's because you have to go in contact by contact.

And we can always automate any of that. Like I can always be like, if you want to think about any kind of like automation of like everything we have, those pathways are laid now. And so to me, it's like, we can do anything we want to with this. However, what's best for y'all.

That's kind of, that was my thought is like, can we just, when Nebula is added. Yeah. that automatically checks the box.

I don't know how you guys do status page with the partners. If there's any of those larger rules of these people all need this, we could always do larger pieces of that too. It'd be hard and fast. Once you do it, it's happening. But like, you know, yeah. So but if we need more kind of like org-wide, we can do that.

What's the timing that we can get this book upload specifically for the Nebula?

I mean, I can look at it and guess what I'm using. Just like, I think... I've got a weird next two days as far as my schedule goes, but I can look at it and see within as far as like early next week at the latest, but probably this week. Is that work or is that bad?

Yeah, that would be great. I think people are like, they like touchy, but only because they're just... Yeah. An incident. And like, obviously this is, Chris, this is taking away everyone having to do this manually. So this is like a huge So thank you. Cool.

I'll look, I'll scope it out some tonight and tomorrow. And I mean, it shouldn't be that bad of a deal to do. And you said QA. Yeah. What do you, what's your thought there?

Yeah. It's just that it's so important if there's like a way that we, how can we like go back and to make sure like it actually went and updated the right statuses for the right people. And so maybe that is even just Madeline and I, you and I do a couple spot checks, but make sure we intentionally do like to do what we, what you and I, Madeline, expected it to do, knowing that we know that there's like a really important end vision that, um, is making sure like nothing gets overwritten.

The Salesforce check is easy, right? Like we can give you a contact report that is, here's everybody with the integration value. Here's their check box. for status page. And like the assumption is everyone who has a checkbox and something else should check there. But I think we probably need some like probably in a sheet, Check of status page itself.

I've already I did that Katie branch this week already for what are existing so I can go do that again once we do this and have the same kind of idea soYeah, that's actually the part I would, To me, it makes more sense almost to go the direction of what's in the status page? Does Salesforce reflect that? Is Scossa correct? You know, and kind of make sure that's kind of the full circle connection there.

Yeah. Is that?

I think that makes sense. And then we can kind of, we can move off of it. We've just seen breakdowns and the breakdowns haven't been Salesforce. The breakdowns have been status page. And so we want to make sure if we're doing this true up, like let's QA it to make sure it's actually.

And I'll say to you, I mean, just on the status page as a whole, like we went to these check boxes because we're getting more and more component based thing, which I think is good. If you guys are like, there's a, there's a, you know, this is a better option. This is just kind of like iteration. So don't feel like we're tied to this. always make the right step, you know, from there. So I just want to say, y'all, I would defer to you guys as far as how you want this to work and I can figure out functionally how it should work, you know, from there.

Yeah. That makes sense. Yeah. Shree and I kind of did this together and I mean, kind of like, you know, this would have made sense there, but we can always change. Yeah. Cool. Good session. This is a lot of good stuff.

Thank you both. Yeah. Excited about this. Appreciate you both. Awesome.

Yeah, I will say tentatively, I'll prioritize that Nebula thing. You can probably get that by end of week for sure on that. If I see if that's going to change, I'll let you guys know. Amazing.

That way we won't have a Saturday nebula incident, I think. Just by doing that.

They told me there wasn't one planned, so I think we're good for right now. Perfect.

Don't tempt fate.

Hey. Thanks, all. Can't stop them. Friday night deploys. It's all good. Can't stop them. Friday night deploys. It's all good. We talked about that already. All right. Thanks, everybody.

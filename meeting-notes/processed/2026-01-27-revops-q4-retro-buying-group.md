There's the birthday boy. How you doing? Thank you. Doing well. What are you doing for your B-Day? So we kind of did the birthday last night. So over the weekend, we were up in the mountains and there's a cool Like... restaurant that's attached to one of the smaller ski areas up there where you can basically ski out at night and then have dinner in a yurt. And then yours, wow. Yeah. That is crunchy.

Yeah, so we did that for dinner last night, but it was so funny 'cause I go, We were skiing back to our car afterwards and it's so cold out. We get to the car and it was negative eight. Yeah, that is really cold. That would explain why my face hurts.

Wow, that's really cold. Yeah. I'm surprised. But...

Yeah, it was a really good time though. The dinner was awesome. The views were great. And, um... Yeah. Yes, we had a great time. That's awesome. What's up, Ramon? Not much, not much. Was that for your birthday, Peter? Yeah, exactly.

How is Texas recovering from some cold weather? You know, starting like Friday of last week, people were preparing for just like the end of the world. But no, it was all right. Isn't it always a bad sign when Ted Cruz leaves the state? Yeah, the Ted Cruz. Rock finder. Flight finder. But yeah, thankfully it wasn't too bad. Just quick freeze over and then it's starting to get like 40s throughout the week.

So everything is kind of melting. Oh, well, you guys survived. What's up, Chris? We did a big one for sure.

Hey, how's it going? What's going on?

The first few minutes... Texas? I'm in Alabama in my childhood bedroom. This is my brother's bedroom because it's a little bit bigger.

Classic. In my mom's house, my house, yep.

How's that going? Have you gotten into a tiff yet with your parents? No, they've been honestly been great. It's been no problem at all. They've cooked a lot of good food and that kind of thing. And they're busy. My stepdad's a teacher, so he's at school and then my mom's out doing stuff. So it's all good. But no, it's been fine. Amazing.

Well, I know Zach's about to join us. Here in a minute. And Chris, apologies for the first...

few minutes here won't be super applicable. I just want to thank Ramon and Peter again for all the help in getting this together. I'm excited to, I'm really excited for this to evolve over the year and just see where we started today or where we ended today and where it'll be at the end of the year. So thank you both so much. Sure. Want to just go through really quickly to make sure that I, we've clarified everything.

Yeah. Now that I have this, I'm just going to take this out. I just wanted to know. Okay. Quick question. What is this all about? This is our Q4 look back. We'll do a preview tomorrow at RevOps Bi-Weekly. But Zach, Peter, Ramon, and others put together kind of a Q4 look back or retro. You'll see there's some overlap in terms of infrastructure that you'll be wanting to do here. But let me just get to this.

aspect accounts.

Thank you. So these are all of our abridged 300 accounts, and these are looking at the last touch points on C-level personas for the clinical notes buying group.

All right, so any account status. Yeah, exactly. Okay. Let's just like, Peter and me as a takeaway, next time, let's just figure out how we want to, and Ramon too, ensure that people know the filters that are applied to it. We just think there are a way that can make... You could be like, oh, these are all in current. You just want to be very clear, either in the graph or somewhere else. So either footnote here could be just helpful.

I can add that footnote in there. Yeah. I think this is one we would also want to say is that we're going through Like, we should see an improvement in the contacts identified across all of those. in the next quarter based on improvements with buying group stuff. Perfect. This is one that I love. This view is great. This one's very interesting, too. Did you say... I had that suggestion just to like...

A couple points of feedback. One, doing notes. I use LH at... LHS or RHS indicate which or upper or lower to indicate which graph you're referring to. So among new lows, early stage conversion rate drops significantly in the second half, showing it was not blah, blah, blah. Where does that relate to? Where should you be looking at? Like... where should you be referencing? Or that could just be a separate takeaway.

You know what I mean?

Yeah, totally. That makes sense. So yeah, so first bullet is basically the overall takeaway of the slide. Then the second bullet is lower right hand side. Yeah, so it would just be...

I wonder if for this view, we have... I wonder if we show like... For like first half, I wonder like... First half, second half.

Yeah, it's a pretty significant drop.

Yeah, so I'm trying to think to open the aperture to compare before and after is what I'm trying to. You have this, which is helpful to do that, I think. Yeah. This slide's important. I was telling Zach last night when I was reading, I was like, the swing is, I love, this thing is a very cool way to look at it. I'm just trying to figure out the best way to make it land.

Yeah, because so,Yeah, so the way that I'm summarizing it is just saying that, you know, this cohort data shows that in the first three quarters. For a Burst-through-Hybrid new logos that results in a closed loss, in a closed loss standpoint, In the first three quarters, they aren't making it out of the first three stages of the opportunity sales process. Yeah, sales process. Like 3.07 is the highest number that you see across, in terms of average sales progression.

Okay, got it, got it, got it.

So I think what I would make, I would just call out an example. Like in Q1, We saw opportunities created in Q1. And maybe it's you include like an average or so. I don't even know if you do, but you can kind of see like the trend line is that clothes loss are going down. earlier and earlier.

Right, yeah. Yeah, like, like, like the deals are like, deals, I guess my main, my main takeaway is just because it's hard to understand, like, give an example.

So looking at like, put it in a footnote or somewhere where it's like, if, like example, looking in Q3, created dates, on average in Q4, went close loss before it reached a line on average, or, you know, whatever that is.

Yeah, exactly. Okay, that makes sense. Yeah, because the key takeaway that I want to emphasize just on this slide is that when we're looking at how do we address these declining win rates on these 300 new logos, like, the like the 90 day mark on these opportunities is where it is basically where they're getting stuck and that's where we need to you know provide some sort of compelling event or really focus on supporting these deals totally Um...

These are hidden... I would either just delete them out Um... Amir is excited about this one. I would just pull out and do a separate. Or put it into an appendix or something. cool yeah because like google slides is not they're gonna he's gonna brian's not gonna like look on the left hand side to see that's hidden He's just going to flip through it.

We can pull those down at the appendix.

Do you know if we pulled out or confirmed nursing on this?

It's just clinical notes. Great.

Can we footnote that somewhere? Yeah. I remember when I put great slide. Did you see that? Yeah. Uh... I think... I would maybe just add a takeaway here that we are meeting as a team to review all of these. In terms of the renewal strategy. Bye bye. All right, that's all I had for this. Zach, before you got here, I thanked everyone because I think this is a great start as the first pass for the year.

I'm excited to see where this goes. where I want people to start to think through for next time. is when making these, when making, um, takeaways and stuff, reference the graph where it is or something to make sure. In the past, I've numbered and called it back or used left hand, right hand in terms of that. And then making sure we're very clear on filters for things. So A300 accounts, do we mean by prospect or all?

Just making sure we're very clear on the... What's included.

Agreed. Perfect.

But really appreciate all of this as well. Same. Okay. You guys can probably clean this up over the next one. Well, I want to pivot really quickly. And this is where the Chris stuff comes in. And I kind of had this idea like seven in the morning today, but I was using restraint and didn't message anyone until then. Wanted to put the kind of brains together and kind of to my thoughts on how we could potentially...

do something kind of interesting from a buying group perspective now that we're getting closer. So the kind of thought would be what if instead of trying to create a score, we just let the AI assess based on criteria that we would look at and just run it nightly and then put a summary on like red, yellow, let it kind of like do its thing. It's like we want to measure it based on three different kind of categories.

Breath, does it have everyone? Um... Frequency, we talk to them a lot. And like depth of that engagement, like are we having them a lot? Those are kind of the three axes I want to measure like holistically to come up with this like, hey, here's our... So here's our view of what buying group strength is. Um... And I wonder if we like, even if I just like probably said that as like, here's how we're trying.

And I can even like record myself being like, you know, for breath, we would want to see it have, you know, most of the core personas on it, which you already have along that. For frequency, we would want consistent contacts within, what is the benchmark we set, Peter? 60 days, 30 days? Yeah. 30 days is great, 60 days is okay, 90 days or more is bad probably. And then for frequency, I would like to see the blend of communication.

If it's just through email or depth, or not frequency, depth we'll call it, I would like to see the complexion of the engagement be holistic. So they're intending different marketing engagements. We've done things, we've not just emailed them, but there's other things that we can do with them. or something else alongside that I think could be helpful to kind of like categorize those things. And it's like, okay, buying group strength, you pull it up and it shows like, you know, for Breath, it's green because you got everything.

For frequency, it's red because you're not talking. Then for depth, whatever it could be. What are your thoughts on that, Chris? I feel like we could use...

Connecting to those three areas to three independent scores.

Yeah, three things so you can kind of see where you're failing and then a holistic score that looks at all of those together.

Okay. It's kind of like three sub scores and one master score. Yeah.

I mean, and then we can basically write prompts that effectively judge the, just like, and just like, cause it's all there.

It's like, just analyze the buying group once a day or whatever it is and run through it. I don't think that could be an interesting thing to test.

And then the output is we're scoring it with one of these three colors as well as like a summary of why we scored it that way.

Exactly. That you can hover and be like, why did it score this way? And it tells you. Yeah, we can do that. I just think that we, I think so. I think we can do it. It sounds like, I just thought like that could be a cool way of just like, instead of having to like think through, this is what was so weird, Peter. I don't know if you've come to this realization yet. I'm so accustomed to making scoring models the way that we've always done, which is like, okay, I need to think through like, here's this.

Instead of just like saying what I want, letting the alum decide to make some judgments to figure out what it does could be a cool way to start to see what happens.

Yeah. Get a first, get a first iteration. Yeah.

And the only thing that I might do is segment this by three different views where it's, Um, The only thing we have to think through is should we weight it differently depending on account status? I mean, a current customer we should have, or we need to index it somehow. So current customers, we'd expect that breadth be complete. We'd expect that certain things would happen. So we might just need to think through if we need to rate them on a curve within each of their respective customers.

I don't know. Yeah.

Okay. That's for bigger brains to decide. We'll kind of layer that in from there. Yeah. Yeah.

Um... Cool. That was basically the one thing I was like, can Chris join the call, Zach? I was just talking about that.

I can take that and start to kind of work with that from there and get some ideas.

A couple other ideas that I have that I'm going to push this team to think through is it sounds like you might need to recreate the account plan as a separate new object, Zach. Is that true? Yeah. That come to you yet? You mentioned it. I don't give a shit.

The only thing is it's just funny, but I do think we could...

I think it doesn't really matter because the world's our oyster. If we do it that way, we could actually build a better UI for all of it, which I think is really cool, which is where I'm going with this. It's like... the coolest thing that I want us to think about is, yes, there's the homepage stuff, but an actual UI that focuses on the account plan that connects all these different things are pretty cool that we can start to think through because It can be super dynamic and more usable in ways that it isn't.

Do you feel like we have a good distillation of why we do account plans?

Sure. Account plans is an ability for us to look at the, and we have that deck we can show you, but it really helps us come to the table from multiple angles on overall account health. So sales comes to the table with their perspective. Partner success comes to the table with their perspective. Other folks that are involved in the deal can come in and participate as well. Clinical success. to make sure that we're moving the customer healthily across where we want them to go.

So if they're green, how do we keep them green? If they're yellow, how do we get them to be green? If they're red, what do we need to do to save them? Then there's other key inflection points that are important for account planning. Number one is pre-sale. So how do we start to think about new logo targets in particular and really thinking through that in more depth? This is a great opportunity for us to start to think through the components that we explored in this last summer of like, okay, The new account...

Sorry, how do I say this in a way that doesn't say a bunch of words that mean a bunch of different things? The account plan for prospect accounts... could be very much like, and Amir has this deck that we'll share with you, but it could be to fill out this stuff, but then it's like more signals on the account. It kind of does like, you know, campaign, like it has the email stuff that you can start to do and start to essentially figure out and explore with an LLM.

How do we open up this account? Yeah. Well, what's the best thing? Then for a current customer, we kind of talked about that. But then for someone that's coming up with a renewal, it's like, okay, what's the renewal strategy? How are we pacing towards all of that as well? Okay, got it. Sure. And yeah. Does that make sense?

It does. Yeah. And I think, I mean, if we're, we are definitely starting to get locked in with, especially with vendors around, you know, what the account plan is limitations. But the good thing is we can always build on top of that as Zach has kind of said.

Yeah. I mean, I think the out of the box account plan has actually been more problematic than good. The only reason I liked it was because of the swap thing looked pretty, but now that was five coding, like we can. Yeah. No one even uses it anyways.

So like, fuck me.

Yeah. But like, you know, it's right. That was a thought that mattered.

What I can do is just take it today how it is and start to kind of sketch out like, okay, we have a course that's the account plan plus the kind of supporting object structure.

Yeah, we have all the pieces. It's just how do we make it in a way that looks better so you can kind of see it as well. Okay. This is where I would imagine Zach, I keep calling Zach's attention, like, Zach, pay attention to me, where key moments and that stuff that we discussed would also be a great place to review that. It's like, okay, where did these things happen? of that work. Right. Like in a timeline?

Something like that, yeah. Yeah, that object sucks. Yeah, we should just reimagine it. I don't care. Good band-aid to rip off.

And it won't be hard. We can just replicate everything in crisp and fine.

Yeah, I mean, well, it's probably to define like also what does the baseline migration look like to get what we already have done into the new format. So we have that context, but then kind of going from there too. So we can figure out how to kind of port everything over in the right way also, so we don't lose what we've already done.

It's probably easy just to transition because most of them are disconnected. It should be fairly straightforward. Right. Okay. Yeah. So that's just something for us to think through as well.

Yeah, makes sense. Yeah, and Zach, you and I have not talked about it directly yet, but I know that's coming as far as recreating that for Plan H.

Yeah, I mean, kind of, you know, we talked about it yesterday on that call and made the decision to do it.

Yeah. Really, all you lose is a SWOT analysis.

I mean, like, Jeremy and I... We can build a SWAT if we want to.

We want a SWAT. We can SWAT it up.

No one does the SWAT stuff anyways, which is like... That's like a couple people do.

But couldn't we visualize a SWAT? What's already there? I mean, we already have all this context and stuff. We know what the SWAT probably even is.

Exactly. I mean, that's what's kind of cool and imagining is we add this summary layer, which you can go to the account plan and then it will generate a summary of everything that's happened recently. So you click on the account plan and we can also show this up. It's like, hey... analyze similar to the buying group, like, hey, which calls have been happening recently, any things that have happened.

You know that account exec summary thing that gets generated from attention? We can basically have a version of that within the UI of the account plan.

I was talking to Matthias last week, too, about just some ideas with them as far as digging in deeper to kind of give us some headless stuff. They could give us an API or an MCP. They were cool with that, too. Yeah, he was like, let's do it.

Okay, yeah, we'll do whatever we want. Did you show him any of the stuff that you built?

Not yet. We're actually supposed to meet. I need to have time with him. I talked to him when I was at the hospital last week.

I want to be there too just so I can... Okay. Make sure hype you up.

Yeah. Cause I, he seemed like immediately open to like any kind of like headless API, just to like, I could prompt against an API as opposed to being on Slack and writing it through the same stuff. Yeah. So that's, I mean, that's, that's a mean to me, that's where I think we have to start getting. That's what I'm gonna be proposing is like, we have these systems that do these really great, you know, kind of knowledge categorization type stuff.

And that's going to be hard for us to roll our own version of that. Correct.

I think we should. No, I don't really want to, but the, Start to use the APIs that they have for these things and put it into a central place. That's the homepage. And you kind of had that. It's like, you know, what do you want to do right now? Grab one of your accounts and actually what you want to do. It'd be pretty sweet.

Yeah, for sure. Okay, cool. I'll start working on this stuff.

Cool. That's all I really have. Peter, I have a few more thoughts on the buying group stuff here. Okay. Which is, I think... I need a view. here above this, which is accounts. without account plans by segment. And then if they don't have anyone in their account plan, remove them for this list. Because like right now, so right now, so not a count, buying group, excuse me, buying group. So for instance, I go into Barlup and I look at, and this is where there's like, when I go into Memorial Care, there's no buying group.

Yeah. They haven't added people, I guess. So if coverage is zero, exclude them and add them to a different list.

I think that's probably two different things too, right?

Exactly. So I want to pull up another thing for customers with missing buying groups. So we buy personals.

Okay.

Yeah, we found a couple, so for sure. And then figure out a way to do that.

Sweet. Yeah, we can totally do that. That makes a ton of sense. Yeah.

Ah, the world's our oyster. It's so crazy.

And then like, okay, Chris, back to the account plan thing. Like as we think about the roadmap stuff, I think like to me, replicating the account plan is like a task. And then the secondary stuff we talked about in terms of like generating information, I think is part of that roadmap.

Yeah. I'm looking at, I'm kind of starting to, I'm working on that actually right now is like how we're kind of starting to like think about the, the layer of like teasing out what the foundation of this stuff is to me. And that's like, purely like data structure, data gathering. To me, it's like the kind of balancing out. We are doing all this work. We're doing things both in Salesforce, but also just in reality that we're capturing into Salesforce that becomes the basis of how we guide them on what's the next step from there.

So I think you have different roles that do different things, but then it's like the same idea is like our job, I think, is to build a system and a surface likely in Salesforce or wherever that basically does the work of like teasing out that context information and to kind of where they go from there. And then I think all this supports that as well. Okay, cool. Does that feel high level? I can, we can look at deeper, but that's kind of where I'm starting with it.

Yeah. You think you can represent that visually simply. Trying to. We'll see. That'll be the key. I'm going to draw it out on paper.

I need a whiteboard. Legitimately, yeah.

Yeah, just a long arrow, basically. um Yeah.

That's just so crazy. Still not get over it. What I kind of would like to be able to produce, and we probably do it pretty soon, is like where our current customers, where buying group strength is weak. By the end of this week, it would be pretty cool to have.

Okay, and we still basically want to kind of get a sense of like, that still effectively needs to be reportable, so we need to store that somewhere that you can look at that pretty easily. Okay, cool. Okay.

Thanks. Anything else? No, Jeremy, can you hang on for a sec? Yes. I'm in trouble. No, you're not.

Peter might be a couple minutes late. We'll see. It's okay. I'm just going to do that H1, H2 update to that table. Great.

And you guys just give me a thumbs up when everything else is resolved on the deck. We'll share it with Brian.

Perfect. Yeah. Sounds good. Let's share that with Amir too. Yeah. He was asking for those updates originally. Cool. Thank you. Thanks. Thanks, everyone. But I only paused my...

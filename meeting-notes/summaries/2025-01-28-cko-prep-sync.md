# CKO Prep Sync

## Decisions

- **Week view over day view** — Homepage should focus on rolling week, not single day
- **UX over AI analysis** — AI enhances layout/experience, not sophisticated analysis on top
- **~10 min presentation slot** — Keep it tight
- **Presentation structure**: What we've shipped → How we think about it (principles) → Where we're going

## Action Items

> [!note] Added as subtasks to CKO AI Roadmap Pres task

- Add technical slide (declarative vs agentic, sales scores as primary layer, inputs/outputs)
- Create wireframes for homepage view + record-level page view
- Shortlist roadmap items for Jeremy meeting tomorrow
- Talk to sales reps (async) about day-to-day SFDC usage
- Add persona bullets (BDR, manager, partner success director, implementation)

## Roadmap Themes Discussed

**Hygiene-focused**
- Next steps (already live)
- Other hygiene features to enable over time

**Risk-focused**
- Stale deals surfacing
- Upcoming calls logged for the week
- Meeting prep support

**Forecast-focused**
- Point-in-time snapshot
- Current quarter / next quarter views

**Homepage & Object functionality**
- Centralized homepage view
- Record-level page view
- Different views per persona

## Open Questions

- Who owns the slides deck? (bring up in team call)
- Should Peter be part of Chris's CKO segment?

## FYIs

- Monday rehearsal in SF — arrive by 3:00 PM (flight lands 2:37)
- Meeting with Taylor at 4:30 today (alerting/enablement stuff ready in production)
- Meeting with Ankit today
- Ramon's resource request Slack work in progress
- Account plan redesign documented from Jeremy's input yesterday

## Travel Notes

- Dallas → SF flight ~4 hours
- Leaves Dallas 11:50, arrives 2:37 PM
- Need to be at venue by 3:00 PM

# Buying Group Support Call

## Issues Resolved

**1. Missing CIO/CMIO contacts on dashboard**
- User thought contacts were already mapped but couldn't find them
- Root cause: Mapping section requires scrolling down on contact page
- Resolution: Showed user where to map contacts (bottom of contact page)

**2. Lead conversion to contact**
- User had a lead (Brad Chrysler) needing conversion for Oneida Health
- Walked through: Convert button (left side) → Search account → Create new contact → Change owner → Convert

## UX Feedback

> [!note] Potential improvement
> Buying group mapping on contact page requires scrolling — user missed it initially. Consider making more prominent.

## Issues to Fix

- Opportunity display bug on CHA account — shows on dashboard despite being attached
- Remove "add member" button from buying group component (moving to contact page)

## FYIs

- Ramon & Catherine Oliver handle new deal kickoffs (closed-won → implementation)
- User has a deal trying to close before CKO

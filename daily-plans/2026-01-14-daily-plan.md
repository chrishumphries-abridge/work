## Active Project Notes

### VA Intel Slack Digest
- **Status**: Canvas working! Core flow operational.
- **Resolved today**:
  - Canvas JSON formatting (newline escaping)
  - Date filtering for items
  - Removed errant `channel_id` from canvas.create payload
- **Added**:
  - RFP tracking subtask (needs scoping)
  - LinkedIn/Legislative date validation guidance
  - Full workflow documentation in project doc
- **Remaining**: Google News workflow fine-tuning, LinkedIn date filtering improvements
- **Docs**: `projects/va-intel/VA-Intel-Slack-Digest-Options.md`

---

## Notes

- Attention Sync Issue is a support request — check the call recording linked in the task
- Contract End Date task has clear logic in notes (Master Contract null check)
- Leads Slack channel task is significantly overdue — consider deferring or closing

---

## Evening Focus (If Working Tonight)

Pick one:

1. **Contract End Date Backfill** — Run the SOQL, get the count, prep Data Loader file. Quick win to close out the parent task.

2. **VA Intel Google News** — Wire up 2-3 of the new source tags in Tray. Test the date/source filtering scripts.

3. **Attention Call Tracking Asks** — ROI calls for Brad, Nursing calls for Emily. Scoped and achievable.

---

### Completed Today
- ✅ VA Intel Slack Digest — Canvas working, full flow operational
- ✅ Planhat Products (Recurring & Non-Recurring)

# Getting Started with Commercial Approvals

This guide will help you understand when approvals are needed and how to request them.

## What is Commercial Approval?

Commercial Approval is a process that ensures certain opportunities receive appropriate review before proceeding. It helps maintain deal quality and ensures proper resource allocation.

## When Do I Need Approval?

You'll need to request approval in two situations:

### 1. Small Deals (Under 10 Physicians)

If your opportunity is with an account that has **fewer than 10 physicians**, you'll need approval from:
1. **Sales Leadership** (first)
2. **Finance** (after Sales Leadership approves)

Both must approve before you can proceed.

### 2. Standard PS Model for Commercial Accounts

If the account:
- Has **Account Segment = Commercial**, AND
- Has **PS Model = Standard**

You'll need approval from **PS Leadership** (one approval).

## How Do I Know If I Need Approval?

When you try to request approval on an opportunity, the system will check automatically:

- **Approval needed** → You'll see a confirmation screen
- **No approval needed** → You'll see a message saying "No Approval Required"

## Quick Start: Requesting Approval

1. Open the **Opportunity** record in Salesforce
2. Click the **Request Commercial Approval** button
3. Review the information shown
4. Click **Submit Request**
5. You'll receive a confirmation that your request was submitted

That's it! The approvers will be notified via Slack and you'll be notified when they decide.

## What Happens Next?

After you submit:

| Step | What Happens |
|------|--------------|
| 1 | Your opportunity shows **Approval Status = Pending** |
| 2 | Approvers receive a Slack message with Approve/Reject buttons |
| 3 | When approved/rejected, you'll be notified |
| 4 | Your opportunity status updates to **Approved** or **Rejected** |

## For Approvers

If you're an approver, you'll receive Slack messages when approval is needed. See the [Approver Guide](how-to/approving-requests.md) for details.

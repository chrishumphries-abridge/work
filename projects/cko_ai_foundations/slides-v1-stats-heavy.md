# Why We're Here

We're an AI company.

But are we all fluent in AI?

This is step one of getting there.

---

# SECTION 1
## The State of AI

---

# SECTION 2
## AI Foundations

---

# What is a Large Language Model?

A system trained on massive amounts of text
that predicts the most likely next word.

Think: autocomplete on steroids.

GPT-4 was trained on ~13 trillion tokens
(roughly 10 million books worth of text)

---

# The Key Insight

Reframe how you think about AI:

**"AI thinks"** → **"AI predicts"**

It doesn't know things. It predicts likely responses.

This is powerful—and also why it hallucinates.

Always verify important outputs.

---

# Generative AI

**Creates content** based on your prompt.

- "Write me an email to follow up on our call"
- "Summarize this 30-page contract"
- "Draft talking points for my QBR"

You prompt. It generates. You review.

---

# Agentic AI

**Takes actions** and uses tools autonomously.

- Monitors signals (site visits, job changes)
- Qualifies leads across channels
- Books meetings when timing is right
- Updates CRM without being asked

This is where AI is heading in 2026.

# Agentic AI: The Numbers

**$7.6B** → **$139B**
Market growth projected by 2033 (18x)

**33% of enterprise software**
Will embed agentic AI by 2028 (Gartner)

**62% of organizations**
Are experimenting with AI agents now

Source: Gartner, McKinsey State of AI 2025

# Generative vs Agentic: Summary

| Generative | Agentic |
|------------|---------|
| Creates content | Takes actions |
| You prompt each time | Works autonomously |
| Reviews require human | Escalates when needed |
| "Write this email" | "Manage my prospecting" |

Both are valuable. Know the difference.

---

# Five Terms to Know

**Prompt** — Your instruction to the AI

**Hallucination** — When AI confidently makes things up

**Context window** — How much AI can "remember" (Claude: ~500 pages)

**Token** — How AI measures text (~1 word = 1.3 tokens)

**Agentic AI** — AI that takes actions, not just generates text

---

# Myths vs Reality

**"AI is coming for my job"**
→ Teams using AI see 83% revenue growth vs 66% for non-users
→ AI augments; it doesn't replace

**"AI knows everything"**
→ Knowledge cutoffs exist (Claude: early 2025)
→ It predicts, it doesn't know

---

# More Myths

**"Only engineers can use AI"**
→ 56% of sales reps use AI daily
→ Best prompts come from domain experts

**"It's too hard to learn"**
→ Basic prompting takes 10 minutes
→ You'll get better with practice

---

# SECTION 3
## Prompting 101

---

# Why Prompting Matters

Great prompts = great outputs.
Bad prompts = garbage outputs.

This is the #1 skill that separates
effective AI users from frustrated ones.

---

# The RCTF Framework

**R**ole — Tell it who to be
**C**ontext — Give background
**T**ask — Be specific about what you want
**F**ormat — Specify the output structure

---

# Role

Tell the AI who to be.

"You are a sales strategist at an AI healthcare company."

"You are a seasoned account executive who has closed 50+ enterprise deals."

"You are a skeptical CFO evaluating this proposal."

This shapes how it thinks and responds.

---

# Context

Give relevant background.

- Who is the customer?
- What's the situation?
- What do you already know?
- What constraints exist?

The more relevant context, the better the output.

---

# Task

Be specific about what you want.

Not: "Help me with this account"

Yes: "Write 3 discovery questions that uncover
their current documentation workflow pain points"

Vague tasks = vague outputs.

---

# Format

Specify how you want the output.

- "As a bulleted list"
- "In 3 short paragraphs"
- "As a table with columns for X, Y, Z"
- "Keep it under 200 words"

This prevents rambling and ensures usability.

---

# Bad Prompt

"Write me a prep doc"

What you get: Generic, probably useless.

---

# Good Prompt

You are a sales strategist at Abridge, an AI clinical documentation company.

I have a meeting tomorrow with Acme Health System, a 500-physician organization in the Midwest. They're currently evaluating AI documentation tools and have expressed concerns about physician adoption.

Write a 1-page meeting prep doc that includes:
- 3 key stakeholders I should research
- 2 likely objections and how to address them
- 3 discovery questions about their current workflow

Keep the tone conversational, not salesy.

---

# The Difference

**Bad prompt:** AI guesses what you want

**Good prompt:** AI delivers what you need

The 60 seconds spent on a better prompt
saves 10 minutes of editing garbage output.

---

# Pro Tips

**Iterate**
First response isn't always best.
"Try again" or "Make it more concise" works.

**Chain of thought**
"Think step by step through..."
Forces better reasoning.

---

# More Pro Tips

**Few-shot examples**
"Here's an example of what good looks like: [example]"
AI mimics patterns you show it.

**Save your winners**
Build a personal library of prompts that work.
Share with your team.

---

# Exercise: AI Mad Libs

Fill in the blanks:

"Write a **[LENGTH]** email to a **[PERSONA]**
in the **[INDUSTRY]** highlighting **[BENEFIT]**
with a **[TONE]** tone."

Run it. Share results.
Funniest or most "sales-ready" wins.

---

# Exercise: Prompt Detective

**Output A:**
"I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to reach out to discuss how our solution could benefit your organization. We offer industry-leading technology that can help streamline your operations. Would you be open to a call?"

**Output B:**
"Dr. Chen — saw Baptist Health just announced their 2026 digital strategy focused on reducing physician burnout. Given your role leading clinical informatics, curious if documentation burden came up in those conversations. We're helping similar systems cut charting time by 2+ hours/day. Worth a 15-min call?"

Which came from a better prompt?

---

# What Made the Difference?

**Output A prompt:** "Write an outreach email"

**Output B prompt:** "You're an Abridge AE. Write a 50-word cold email to Dr. Sarah Chen, Chief Clinical Informatics Officer at Baptist Health (12-hospital system, Southeast). Reference their recent digital strategy announcement. Focus on physician burnout and documentation time savings. Tone: consultative, not salesy."

Same AI. Wildly different results.

# SECTION 4
## The Tools

---

# How We Got Here

**2020-2022: Content Libraries**
Static decks, battle cards, Confluence pages
You had to know where to look

**2023-2024: ChatGPT Moment**
Suddenly anyone could ask questions in plain English
But outputs were generic, often wrong

**2025+: AI Gets Context**
Tools that know your company, your customers, your deals
Outputs that are actually useful

---

# The Opportunity

General-purpose AI is now accessible to everyone.

But most people use it like a search engine.

The ones who learn to use it well?
They're the ones pulling ahead.

---

# What is Vibe Coding?

Term coined by Andrej Karpathy (OpenAI co-founder), Feb 2025.

"Give in to the vibes. Forget the code exists."

Describe what you want → AI writes the code →
You test it → Give feedback → Iterate

Collins Dictionary Word of the Year 2025.

---

# Vibe Coding: The Reality

**25% of Y Combinator startups** (Winter 2025)
have codebases that are 95% AI-generated.

Non-engineers are building tools, automations,
and prototypes that used to require developers.

The line between "user" and "builder" is blurring.

---

# A Word of Caution

Vibe coding is great for:
- Prototypes and experiments
- Personal productivity tools
- Learning and exploration

Be careful with:
- Production systems
- Anything involving sensitive data
- Code you don't understand at all

---

# SECTION 5
## Where We Go From Here

---

# The Adoption Curve

**By 2027:** Sales professionals will start
95% of their research with AI (up from 20% in 2024)

**92% of companies** plan to increase
AI investment over the next 3 years

This isn't optional anymore.

# RevOps is Paving the Way

We're building AI into your workflows:
- Meeting prep automation
- Account research tools
- Next steps tracking
- Pipeline intelligence

Your feedback shapes what we build next.

---

# Your Next Steps

1. **Pick ONE tool** to try this week

2. **Start with a repeatable task**
   (Email drafts, meeting prep, research)

3. **Use the RCTF framework**
   Role, Context, Task, Format

4. **Share what works** with your team

---

# Start Small

Don't try to transform everything at once.

Pick one task you do every week.
Try using AI for it.
Iterate until it's actually helpful.

Then pick another.

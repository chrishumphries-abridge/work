## Next Steps

### 1. Decide on Charter Version
- [ ] Review `ai_charter.md` vs `ai_charter_tight.md`
- [ ] Pick one for the presentation (tight version fits on a single slide)

### 2. Build the Slides
- [ ] Create deck in Keynote/Google Slides
- [ ] Follow `presentation_outline.md` structure
- [ ] Screenshot mockups and embed in slides
- [ ] Keep it visual — minimal text, big images

### 3. Mockup Screenshots
- [ ] Open each HTML mockup in browser
- [ ] Take clean screenshots (hide browser chrome)
- [ ] Save to `mockups/screenshots/` for easy embedding

### 4. Review & Refine
- [ ] Run through the deck once
- [ ] Cut anything that feels like filler
- [ ] Make sure "Live" vs "Ready to Launch" vs "Exploring" is clear
- [ ] Confirm the story arc: Problem → Foundation → What's Live → What's Next

### 5. Optional Enhancements
- [ ] Add a "Buying Group Members" mockup (currently live, no mockup yet)
- [ ] Add animation/transitions to slides if presenting live
- [ ] Prepare a 2-minute and 5-minute version

## Key Messages to Land

1. **Foundation first** — 2025 was about building the data layer (Buying Group, Email Sync, Conversation Intelligence). Without it, AI is useless.

2. **Next Steps Hygiene is live** — Real feature, shipping value today. AI suggests what to do next based on your activity.

3. **More is ready** — Deal Risk Signals and Deal Intelligence are built. Ready to turn on.

4. **The roadmap is practical** — Meeting Prep, expanded Buying Group research. Not promises, just plans.

5. **The standard** — We're not building AI for AI's sake. We're making you more effective.

## Presentation Tips

- Don't oversell. The power is in simplicity.
- Show the mockups — visuals > bullet points.
- Connect to their pain: "You've prepped for a meeting by digging through old emails. That's what we're fixing."
- Under-promise. "Exploring" means exploring, not committed.

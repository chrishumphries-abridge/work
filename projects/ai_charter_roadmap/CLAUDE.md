# CKO 2026 Presentation Prep

Three presentations, three folders.

---

## The Three Sessions

### Session 1: Main Stage
**Folder:** `main_stage/`
**Format:** Video presentation (auto-advance)
**Audience:** All of CKO
**Content:** The story — constraint → AI unlock → shipped work → "how we got here"

Opens with "Working in Salesforce has constraints." Salesforce is hierarchical — seeing everything in one place is nearly impossible. UX has only improved twice in 20 years (Classic → Lightning). Shows how AI (Claude Code, Tray, JASPT) removed the ceiling. Includes video of Next Steps AI generation happening live. Ends on Account Page tease.

**Jeremy feedback (Feb 2026):**
- Add Tray.io to tools mentioned alongside Claude Code
- Record video of Next Steps actually being generated (show the "doing it" moment)
- Talk track: hierarchical data structure → hard to see everything → UX stagnant → AI unlocks custom dev

### Session 2: RevOps Showcase
**Folder:** `revops_showcase/`
**Format:** Pre-recorded video walkthrough of account page mockup
**Audience:** Commercial team breakout
**Content:** "Where we're going" — Account Page is the centerpiece

Major pivot from Jeremy meeting: Account Page is now the star, not a tease. Pre-recorded video walking through the mockup (screen sharing not available — everything pre-recorded). Don't rehash Next Steps. Show engagement criteria as the evolution. Status Page gets reimagined as a project teams modal.

**Jeremy feedback (Feb 2026):**
- Account Page = centerpiece. Jeremy was blown away. This session = "where we're going"
- Don't rehash Next Steps — show engagement criteria as the next evolution
- Status Page → reimagine as project teams management widget (like buying group modal)
- Make account page wider / full page
- Right-hand orchestration panel is the star — show modal click-throughs
- Sigma dashboard + Google Drive links = "brilliant"
- Account plan: just "active account plan" with click-through, not full content
- Add: mutual action plan to right-hand side
- Add: "chat with this account" concept
- Shout out Ramon for help requests work
- Show how to kick off actions even if output isn't built yet
- Bring in engagement stuff under buying groups

---

### Session 3: AI Foundations
**Folder:** `ai_foundations/`
**Format:** Slides (15 min) + pre-recorded vibe coding demo (~30 min)
**Audience:** Commercial team (opt-in)
**Content:** AI 101 + live-style vibe coding demo

15 min foundational: agentic vs generative, prompting 101, prompting framework. Then pre-recorded vibe coding demo — poll audience for ideas/sketches of what they'd want built, pick one, show building a first pass. Ties into Shiv's main stage talk about AI tools at Abridge.

**Jeremy feedback (Feb 2026):**
- Foundational content: agentic vs generative, prompting 101, prompting frameworks
- Vibe coding demo — take audience poll for ideas, pick one feasible option, build first pass
- 15 min foundational, ~30 min team activity / demo
- Connects to Shiv's main stage talk about what AI tools Abridge offers
- "People can present ideas and sketches of things they'd want"

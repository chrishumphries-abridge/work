# CKO 5-Minute Talk: Our AI Journey

**Time:** 5 minutes
**Format:** Breakout session
**Story:** Where we started → What accelerated us → Where we're going

---

## Structure

| Section | Time | Content |
|---------|------|---------|
| **Where We Started** | 1 min | Early AI days, the constraints we faced |
| **What Accelerated Us** | 1.5 min | AI-assisted development as the unlock |
| **What We've Shipped** | 1 min | Proof it works — Buying Groups, Next Steps |
| **Where We're Going** | 1.5 min | Account Page reveal — the vision |

---

## Section 1: Where We Started (1 min)

### The Constraint

> "For years, we were boxed in by what Salesforce would let us do. Drag a field here, add a component there. The native layout tools gave us options, but they were always within the box Salesforce drew for us."

> "We had ideas for better experiences — better ways to see your accounts, your pipeline, your deals — but building them meant custom development. That meant time, that meant resources, that meant it usually didn't happen."

### Early AI Experiments

> "Last year, we started experimenting with AI. Could we use it to help reps? Could we surface insights? We built some early things — some worked, some didn't. That's the nature of this stuff."

> "But the bigger unlock wasn't the features themselves."

---

## Section 2: What Accelerated Us (1.5 min)

### The Real Unlock

> "The real unlock was realizing we could use AI to *build* — not just to power features, but to develop them."

> "I can now take a conversation like this one, feed it into Claude, and have a working prototype in hours. Not weeks. Hours."

### What This Means

> "We're no longer limited to what Salesforce's native layouts can do. We can reimagine what Salesforce looks like — and actually build it."

> "So we're applying AI in two ways: AI powers the features you use, *and* AI powers how fast we can build them."

### The Principles We Landed On

As we experimented, we learned what works:

| Principle | What it means |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Foundation First** | AI is only as good as its data |
| **Earn the Right** | Build blocks before complex views |
| **Ship What Helps** | If it doesn't make your job easier, we don't build it |
| **Easier Than Default** | Has to be easier than ChatGPT or existing tools |

---

## Section 3: What We've Shipped (1 min)

### The Foundation (quick)

> "Before any of this could work, we needed the data. In 2025, we built the infrastructure."

- **Buying Groups** — We know who's involved in every deal
- **Email Activity Sync** — Every touchpoint captured automatically
- **Conversation Intelligence** — Calls and transcripts linked to deals

### Live in Production

**Buying Group Members**
> "See who's involved in every deal at a glance. Know your champion, your budget holder, who's engaged, who's gone quiet."

**Next Steps Hygiene**
> "AI reads your recent activity and suggests what to do next. One click to update. No more forgotten follow-ups."

> "Both are live. Right now. In Salesforce. Built with this approach."

---

## Section 4: Where We're Going (1.5 min)

### The Next Step

> "So where does this lead? We're focused on one thing next: the Account Page."

> "We realized we can't build territory views or homepages until we nail the account experience. The account is the atomic unit. Get that right, and everything else cascades from it."

### Reveal the Mockup

> "This is what we're building."

Walk through:
1. **Account summary** — The "Twitter version" of what's happened
2. **Buying Group** — Visual with engagement levels, front and center
3. **Opportunities** — All deals on this account, with context
4. **Key Moments** — Recent activity, important events
5. **Orchestration Panel** — "What do you want to do?" Launch agents right from here

### The Vision

> "Everything you need to know about an account — and everything you can do with it — in one place. No digging. No clicking around."

> "And because we can prototype this fast, we can iterate with you. Show you something, get feedback, build the next version. That's the new pace."

### Close

> "This is where we're headed. We'll keep earning the right to build more — but it starts here, with the account."

## Key Messages to Land

1. **AI unlocked how we build** — We're no longer limited to native Salesforce; we can reimagine the whole experience
2. **We shipped real things** — Buying Groups and Next Steps are in production, not concepts
3. **Speed changed** — Prototype in hours, not sprints; iterate fast
4. **Account-first** — We're earning the right to build more by nailing the foundation
5. **Ship what helps** — If it doesn't make your job easier, we don't build it

---

## What NOT to Say

- No specific roadmap promises beyond Account Page
- No time estimates
- Don't oversell — emphasize that some experiments didn't work, that's fine
- Don't promise deal risk scoring or forecasting — we haven't earned the right yet
- Don't claim we've "solved" anything — we're learning and iterating

---

## Visuals Needed

1. Simple slide: "Where we started" (maybe a screenshot of native SFDC layout?)
2. Buying Group screenshot (live)
3. Next Steps Hygiene screenshot (live)
4. **Account Page mockup** — the reveal (open `mockups/account_page.html`)

---

## If Asked About Roadmap

> "We're focused on the Account Page right now. Once we nail that, it cascades — Opportunities, Contacts, then territory views. But we're earning the right to each step. We'll share more as we learn."

---

## If Elevated to Main Stage

Same story, but potentially add:
- Live demo of how Claude Code works
- Show the "guts" — feed in a conversation, get a prototype
- Could even show this meeting's transcript → mockup flow

## Slide-by-Slide Content

### Slide 1: Title
**Headline:** GTM Systems AI
**Subhead:** Our journey from constraints to possibilities

*Speaker notes: Quick intro, set the stage. Don't linger here.*

---

### Slide 2: The Box We Were In
**Headline:** We had ideas. Salesforce had limits.

**Visual:** Screenshot of native Salesforce account layout (cluttered, field-heavy)

*Speaker notes:*
> "For years, we were boxed in by what Salesforce would let us do. Drag a field here, add a component there. We had ideas for better experiences, but building them meant custom development — time and resources we didn't have."

---

### Slide 3: Early Experiments
**Headline:** We started experimenting with AI.

**Bullets:**
- Could we surface insights for reps?
- Could we automate the tedious stuff?
- Some worked. Some didn't.

*Speaker notes:*
> "Last year, we started experimenting. Could AI help reps? Could we surface insights? We built some early things — some worked, some didn't. That's the nature of this. But the bigger unlock wasn't the features themselves."

---

### Slide 4: The Real Unlock
**Headline:** AI didn't just power features. It changed how we build.

**Visual:** Simple before/after
- Before: Weeks to prototype
- After: Hours

*Speaker notes:*
> "The real unlock was realizing we could use AI to build — not just to power features, but to develop them. I can take a conversation, feed it into Claude, and have a working prototype in hours. We're no longer limited to what Salesforce gives us. We can reimagine what Salesforce looks like — and actually build it."

---

### Slide 5: What We Learned
**Headline:** Principles that stuck.

| Principle | |
|-----------|---|
| **Foundation First** | AI is only as good as its data |
| **Earn the Right** | Build blocks before complex views |
| **Ship What Helps** | If it doesn't make your job easier, we don't build it |
| **Easier Than Default** | Has to beat ChatGPT and existing tools |

*Speaker notes:*
> "As we experimented, we learned what works. These are the principles we keep coming back to."

---

### Slide 6: The Foundation
**Headline:** Before AI could help, it needed to see what you see.

**Bullets:**
- Buying Groups — who's in every deal
- Email Activity — every touchpoint captured
- Conversation Intelligence — calls linked to deals

*Speaker notes:*
> "Before any of this could work, we needed the data. In 2025, we built the infrastructure. This is the foundation everything runs on."

---

### Slide 7: What's Live — Buying Groups
**Headline:** See who's involved. At a glance.

**Visual:** Screenshot of Buying Group component in Salesforce

*Speaker notes:*
> "Buying Group Members. See who's involved in every deal — your champion, your budget holder, who's engaged, who's gone quiet. Live in Salesforce right now."

---

### Slide 8: What's Live — Next Steps
**Headline:** AI suggests what to do next.

**Visual:** Screenshot of Next Steps Hygiene component

*Speaker notes:*
> "Next Steps Hygiene. AI reads your recent activity and suggests what to do next. One click to update. No more forgotten follow-ups. Also live, right now, built with this approach."

---

### Slide 9: Where This Leads
**Headline:** The account is the atomic unit.

**Bullet:**
- Nail the account experience first
- Then it cascades: Opportunities, Contacts, Territory views

*Speaker notes:*
> "So where does this lead? We're focused on one thing next: the Account Page. We realized we can't build territory views or homepages until we nail the account experience. Get that right, and everything else cascades from it."

---

### Slide 10: The Account Page [REVEAL]
**Headline:** Everything about an account. One place.

**Visual:** Account Page mockup (full screen)

*Speaker notes:*
> "This is what we're building."

Walk through sections:
1. "Account summary — the Twitter version of what's happened"
2. "Buying Group front and center"
3. "All opportunities with context"
4. "Key moments — recent activity, important events"
5. "Orchestration panel — what do you want to do? Launch actions right from here"

---

### Slide 11: The New Pace
**Headline:** Prototype in hours. Iterate with you.

**Bullets:**
- Show you something
- Get feedback
- Build the next version

*Speaker notes:*
> "And because we can prototype this fast, we can iterate with you. Show you something, get feedback, build the next version. That's the new pace."

---

### Slide 12: Close
**Headline:** We're earning the right to build more.

**Subhead:** It starts with the account.

*Speaker notes:*
> "This is where we're headed. We'll keep earning the right to build more — but it starts here, with the account."

---

## Slide Design Notes

**General principles:**
- One idea per slide
- Headlines do the heavy lifting — if someone only reads headlines, they get the story
- Minimal bullets (3 max)
- Screenshots/mockups are the stars, not text
- Dark background for mockup reveals (makes them pop)
- Consistent layout: headline top, visual center, no clutter

**Timing guide:**
- Slides 1-3: ~1 min (setup)
- Slides 4-5: ~1 min (the unlock + principles)
- Slides 6-8: ~1 min (foundation + shipped)
- Slides 9-12: ~2 min (vision + close)

---

*The story is the journey. The Account Page is the proof. Keep it tight.*

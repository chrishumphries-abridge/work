# Main Stage: AI as a Multiplier

**Segment:** How We Choose Action: AI as a Multiplier
**When:** Tuesday, 10:25-10:55 (5 min slot)
**After:** Brad's ROI calculator demo

---

## The Story

Salesforce admins have always been limited to declarative — point-and-click. AI coding agents removed that ceiling. Same skillset, way more possible.

**Not the narrative:** "I had to wait on devs"
**The narrative:** "The tools had limits, now they don't"

## Talking Points (5 min)

1. Intro — who you are, what you do (30 sec)
2. The old world — Salesforce is hierarchical, UX hasn't improved in 20 years (Classic → Lightning). Declarative ceiling. (1 min)
3. The unlock — AI coding agents: Claude Code, Tray, JASPT. "This looks scarier than it actually is." (1 min)
4. Video plays — include Next Steps generation happening live (60-90 sec)
5. What this means — ceiling is gone (45 sec)
6. Close — "Same admin skillset. Way more possible." Account Page tease. (15 sec)

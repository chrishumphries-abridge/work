# Main Stage: AI as a Multiplier

**Segment:** How We Choose Action: AI as a Multiplier
**When:** Tuesday, 10:25-10:55 (5 min slot)
**After:** Brad's ROI calculator demo

## The Story

Salesforce admins have always been limited to declarative — point-and-click. AI coding agents removed that ceiling. Same skillset, way more possible.

**Not the narrative:** "I had to wait on devs"
**The narrative:** "The tools had limits, now they don't"

## Slide Content

### WHAT I BUILT

Custom Salesforce components that weren't possible with point-and-click:
- **Buying Groups** — visual map of who's in every deal
- **Next Steps Hygiene** — AI-suggested follow-up actions
- **Account Page** — reimagined account experience (in progress)

### IMPACT

Removed the ceiling on what a Salesforce admin can build.
- Ideas go from concept to production in hours, not sprints
- Can iterate based on feedback immediately
- Building what the team actually needs, not what the tools allow

### TOOLS

- **Claude Code** — AI coding agent for building
- **Claude.ai** — brainstorming, drafting, problem-solving

## Video Recording (~60-90 sec)

**Concept:** Quick screen capture showing one of the shipped components in action.

**Script outline:**

1. **Set up** (10 sec)
   - "Salesforce admins have always been limited to declarative — point-and-click, drag-and-drop. That's a ceiling."

2. **The unlock** (15 sec)
   - "AI coding agents removed that ceiling. I can describe what I want and build it — without being a developer."

3. **Show the result** (45-60 sec)
   - Screen recording of Buying Groups or Next Steps in Salesforce
   - Walk through what it does, how reps use it
   - "This is live. In production. Built with Claude Code."

4. **Close** (10 sec)
   - "Same admin skillset. Way more possible."

## Talking Points (5 min total)

**0:00 - Intro** (30 sec)
- Quick intro: who you are, what you do
- "I'm going to show you what happens when you give a Salesforce admin an AI coding agent."

**0:30 - The Old World** (1 min)
- Declarative building: flows, page layouts, Lightning App Builder
- Powerful, but there's a ceiling
- Custom components meant Apex, LWC — a different skillset

**1:30 - The Unlock** (1 min)
- AI coding agents (Claude Code) changed that
- I can describe what I want in plain English
- It writes the code, I iterate, we ship

**2:30 - Video plays** (60-90 sec)
- Let the video do the work
- Shows the component in action

**4:00 - What This Means** (45 sec)
- The ceiling is gone for anyone willing to try
- Started small, built confidence, now shipping production features
- "If you have ideas you've been sitting on — this is how you build them."

**4:45 - Close** (15 sec)
- "Same admin skillset. Way more possible."

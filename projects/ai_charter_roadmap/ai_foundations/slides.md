## Slide Outline

### Section 1: Opening (~15 min) - "Chris's Corner"

**Slide 1: Title**
- "AI Foundations for Commercial"
- Chris Humphries, RevOps
- (Walk-on music plays as people enter)

**Slide 2: Why We're Here**
- We're an AI company - but are we all "AI-pilled"?
- This is step one of a year-long journey
- Safe space to ask questions

**Slide 3: State of the Market (Stats)**
- Healthcare AI adoption: 67% of clinicians using AI daily, 90% weekly
- [ ] TODO: Find stat on revenue team AI adoption
- [ ] TODO: Find stat on where our stakeholders/partners are with AI

**Slide 4: Poll - Where Are You?**
- Mentimeter or Kahoot (QR code)
- Questions:
  1. "How often do you use AI tools?" (Daily / Weekly / Rarely / Never)
  2. "What do you primarily use it for?" (Open text or multiple choice)

**Slide 5: The Spectrum**
- Visual: "Doing nothing" ← → "Claude Code / Vibe Coding"
- Most people should be somewhere in the middle
- Today's goal: help you find your spot

### Section 2: AI Foundations

**Slide 6: What is a Large Language Model (LLM)?**
- Plain English explanation
- "Autocomplete on steroids" - predicts next word based on patterns
- Trained on massive amounts of text
- Key point: It doesn't "know" things, it predicts likely responses

**Slide 7: Generative vs Agentic AI**
- **Generative**: Creates content (text, images, code) based on prompts
  - Example: "Write me an email to..."
- **Agentic**: Takes actions, uses tools, works autonomously
  - Example: "Research this account and update Salesforce"
- Where we're headed: more agentic capabilities

**Slide 8: Glossary - Terms You'll Hear**
| Term | What it means |
|------|---------------|
| Prompt | The instruction you give the AI |
| Token | How AI measures text (roughly 4 chars = 1 token) |
| Context window | How much the AI can "remember" in one conversation |
| Hallucination | When AI confidently makes stuff up |
| Fine-tuning | Training AI on specific data for better results |
| RAG | Retrieval-Augmented Generation - AI that can search/reference docs |

**Slide 9: What You Might Have Heard (Myths vs Reality)**
- "AI is coming for my job" → Reality: AI augments, changes jobs
- "AI knows everything" → Reality: Knowledge cutoffs, hallucinations
- "AI is always right" → Reality: Verify important outputs
- "Only engineers can use AI" → Reality: Everyone can benefit

### Section 3: Prompting 101

**Slide 10: Who Prompts?**
- Everyone in this room can (and should)
- You don't need to be technical
- It's a skill that improves with practice

**Slide 11: Basic Prompting Framework**
1. **Role**: Tell it who to be ("You are a sales strategist...")
2. **Context**: Give background ("I'm preparing for a meeting with...")
3. **Task**: Be specific about what you want ("Write 3 talking points...")
4. **Format**: Specify output format ("As a bulleted list...")

**Slide 12: Bad vs Good Prompt Example**

❌ **Bad**: "Write me a prep doc"

✅ **Good**: "You are a sales strategist at an AI healthcare company. I have a meeting with [Account Name], a 500-physician health system in the Midwest. They're currently evaluating AI documentation tools. Write a 1-page prep doc with: key stakeholders to know, likely objections, and 3 discovery questions to ask."

**Slide 13: Interactive - AI Mad Libs** (Optional)
- Fill-in-the-blank prompt builder
- "You are a [ROLE]. I need help with [TASK]. The context is [CONTEXT]. Please provide [OUTPUT FORMAT]."
- Have people try it on their phones

**Slide 14: Pro Tips**
- Iterate - first response isn't always best
- "Try again" or "Make it more concise" works
- Share what worked with your team
- Save good prompts for reuse

### Section 4: Our Tech Stack

**Slide 15: The Big Three**
| Tool | Best For | Access at Abridge |
|------|----------|-------------------|
| **ChatGPT** | General purpose, creative, image gen | Personal use |
| **Claude** | Writing, analysis, professional work, coding | Developer license available |
| **Perplexity** | Research with citations, current events | Personal use |

**Slide 16: Claude vs ChatGPT - Chris's Take**
- Claude: Better for work/professional, writing, nuanced tasks
- ChatGPT: Good for creative, broader general knowledge
- Both improving rapidly - try both, find what works

**Slide 17: What Abridge Offers**
- [ ] TODO: Confirm current access/licensing details with IT
- Claude Code developer license available
- Enterprise Claude coming (TBD)
- How to request access: [link]

**Slide 18: Beyond Chat - Developer Tools**
- Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, etc.
- "Vibe coding" - using AI to build without being an engineer
- Breaking the glass ceiling between "end user" and "builder"
- Not just for engineers anymore

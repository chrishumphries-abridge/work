# GTM Systems AI — RKO Presentation Outline

**Audience:** Full commercial team (non-technical)
**Goal:** Charter, Foundation, Roadmap — inspire confidence without over-promising

---

## Slide 1: Title
**GTM Systems AI**
*Every interaction becomes insight.*

Alternative taglines:
- "The right context, at the right moment."
- "Your work, always working for you."

---

## Slide 2: The Problem

**You do a lot of work.**
- Calls. Emails. Meetings. Research.
- Every interaction generates information.

**But that work doesn't accumulate.**
- You start every deal from scratch.
- You dig through old emails to prep for meetings.
- You wonder if you're missing something.

---

## Slide 3: What We're Building

**An intelligence layer that works for you.**

Not more dashboards. Not more reports.
Just the right context, at the right moment.

*"What should I do next?"* — We answer that.

---

## Slide 4: Who We Serve

| Team | Their Question | How We Help |
|------|----------------|-------------|
| **Sales** | "What should I do next?" | AI-powered guidance on every deal |
| **Partner Success** | "Which accounts need me?" | Proactive health signals |
| **Leadership** | "Where do I coach?" | Evidence-based visibility |
| **Everyone** | "How do I find what I need?" | Right resource, right moment |

---

## Slide 5: Our Principles

1. **Foundation First** — AI is only as good as its data
2. **Meet You Where You Work** — Salesforce, Planhat, Slack
3. **Context, Not Complexity** — Don't overwhelm
4. **Anticipate, Don't Ask** — Know what you need before you search

---

## Slide 6: The Foundation (2025)

**Before AI can help, it needs to see what you see.**

We built the data infrastructure:

| What We Built | What It Means |
|---------------|---------------|
| **Buying Group Tracking** | We know who's involved in every deal |
| **Email Activity Sync** | Every touchpoint is captured automatically |
| **Conversation Intelligence** | Call recordings and transcripts linked to deals |

*This is the foundation everything else runs on.*

---

## Slide 7: What's Live Today

### Next Steps Hygiene
*AI that helps you keep your pipeline current.*

- Surfaces deals missing a next step
- Flags stale next steps (not updated in 7+ days)
- **AI suggests what to do next** — based on your recent activity
- One click to update

[Show screenshot or mockup]

---

## Slide 8: What's Live Today (continued)

### Buying Group Members
*See who's involved in every deal.*

- Stakeholders by role (Champion, Budget Holder, etc.)
- Engagement tracking by person
- Gaps flagged: "You're missing a technical champion"

[Show screenshot or mockup]

---

## Slide 9: What's Next — Ready to Launch

### Deal Risk Signals
*Proactive alerts when deals show warning signs.*

- "No activity in 14 days"
- "No executive sponsor identified"
- "Closing in 7 days, champion hasn't responded"
- AI explains *why* it's flagged — not just that it is

*Built and tested. Ready to turn on.*

---

## Slide 10: The Roadmap — H1 2026

| Feature | For | Status |
|---------|-----|--------|
| **Next Steps Hygiene** | Sales | Live |
| **Buying Group Members** | Sales | Live |
| **Personal Forecast** | Sales | Ready to Launch |
| **Deal Risk Signals** | Sales | Ready to Launch |
| **Buying Group Expansion** | Ent/Strat/National | In Progress |
| **Meeting Prep Brief** | Sales, PS | Exploring |
| **Next Best Action** | Sales | Exploring |

---

## Slide 11: What Becomes Possible

As the foundation grows, so do the possibilities:

**Meeting Prep**
*"Prep me for my 2pm."*
→ Who you're meeting, recent context, suggested talking points

**Proactive Alerts**
*"This deal went quiet."*
→ Silence detection, stakeholder triggers, competitive signals

**On-Demand Analysis**
*"What's the status of the Acme deal?"*
→ Natural language Q&A about your pipeline

---

## Slide 12: The Pattern

Every feature follows the same model:

```
Your Work → Data Foundation → AI Layer → Guidance
```

- The more you use Salesforce, the smarter it gets
- The AI reads what you're doing and surfaces what you need
- No extra work required — it's built into your workflow

---

## Slide 13: The Standard

> **We're not building AI features.**
> **We're helping you do your job better.**

Not flashy demos. Not buzzwords.
Useful tools that save you time and make you more effective.

---

## Slide 14: Questions?

GTM Systems & Analytics
*Turning your work into your guidance.*

# Visual Concept Ideas

For the "What's Live" and "What's Next" slides, consider showing:

1. **Next Steps Hygiene** — Screenshot of the actual UI showing:
   - A deal card with "No Next Step" badge
   - The AI suggestion box
   - The "Update" button

2. **Buying Group Members** — Screenshot showing:
   - List of stakeholders with roles (badges)
   - Engagement indicators (last connected, last email)
   - The group header with completeness %

3. **Deal Risk Signals** — Mockup showing:
   - Risk card with colored indicators (red/yellow/green)
   - Signal list with specific reasons
   - "Here's what to do about it" suggestion

# Notes for Presenter

- **Don't oversell.** The power is in the simplicity. "It just surfaces what you need."
- **Emphasize foundation.** This isn't magic — it's the result of good data infrastructure.
- **Connect to their pain.** Everyone's prepped for a meeting by digging through old emails. That's the problem we're solving.
- **Under-promise.** Better to say "exploring" than to commit to dates.
- **Show real UI.** Even rough screenshots are more compelling than concepts.

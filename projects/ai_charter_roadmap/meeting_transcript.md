Ayo.

Hello. Are you done?

Good. Some hockey stack. That's kind of coming together. Nice.

I've got to change my attitude towards some meat. Okay. I don't know. Something about this irks me. That's wrong of me. But I don't know. I think it's just like we're always gonna put in like really half baked ideas. Yeah.

And he's like the in-between a lot of times. So you got to know he's like just carrying out something.

No, it's me. It's not. I just kind of like get a little more softer to him on some stuff. I'll work on that.

Okay, that's good.

You hold me to that? Okay.

Watch it, bud.

No, it's just like all the same stuff. It's just like... I just... I don't know. It's just like hook up Salesforce. Why? I don't know. It was like kind of unclear. Yeah. I think it was okay for us to ask a lot of questions.

Yeah.

As long as you're okay with me doing those things. And that's what I worried about. I was like, am I being too intense in that way?

Yeah. I think you just gotta watch for coming off as like oh we're not gonna do this yeah yeahI think ultimately we will, I think. And he agreed with not adding records to Salesforce and stuff like that.

I mean, I looked at it, it was like literally like 30 fields to add in on for their integration. I was like, okay. I've been there before. Right.

And we can talk. You don't have to do all 30 of that. Yeah.

It's like, we were probably gonna use one of these out of 30 of them.

Well, yeah, I enjoyed it. He was like, well, they're not in that.

And if we don't use it, then it's like I got to delete 30 fields. You know, so it's like, I mean, which is fine, but it's just... the little things.

Everybody's getting their toys. We talk. It was back to us. Yeah.

But you're ready for a little break. Yeah, hopefully about that guys.

Hey. Oh, you're good. I was wrapping up another call that I'm really excited about.

The CBS stuff is really cool.

So good.

It's really cool. It's really cool.

That's very, very cool. I don't know what the mode is on it, but very cool regardless. Alright, I'm gonna cut this. This is my most exciting meeting I am the whole day. Wow. Chris, I do have to warn you. I wouldn't be surprised if you accidentally get elevated to the main stage at ALCO and get bumped up because they're trying to do this new AI pilling thing for the company. And I wouldn't be surprised if they kind of trot you out there.

What does that mean? It means that you might be presenting in front of the entire company.

I'm fine with that, first off. Second off, I'll just make sure I know the right things to show. I don't know what it's going to be. I think it might be more like guts, like how you actually did it and examples of it and how it came to be, but we'll figure it out. I just wanted to give you a warning. My big fear is always doing this stuff in front of real engineers. And then being like, this guy's full of shit.

Well, I think the reality is that like... You're not full of shit because it's working in production. I don't see too many of those people deploying five-quoted stuff into production these days. That's fair. I'll put the gauntlet down on that one. Okay. I'll take it. My way of hearing would be like IT being like, what are you doing?

Also that too, like, it's like, I'm speaking and Zach Powers comes up to my desk and takes me off stage.

And they take away my buying group. They just grab the microphone away from me.

I literally was run away. Do you remember the pumps where they tried to take like Kanye West's laptop or whatever? No, that's fine.

I'm good with that for sure. I just want to make sure I have it.

I don't know what it's going to be, but I think it'd be kind of cool. Yeah, I agree.

I mean, to me, this is great. I definitely want to jump into those and be a part of those conversations.

Yeah. I think it's a great opportunity for you as a, to be seen as a leader.

I appreciate you like wanting to do it. So it's all good.

I was our representative on those channels and I probably shouldn't have been. I hate AI. Fuck AI.

No, not that. Just like, I don't know as much as you do. And they're like, what do you guys use? And I was like, very little.

What is AI? We use Microsoft Copilot for everything.

I don't know what you've been told, but we're not doing anything. Okay.

Um, In order for this not to just be me word vomiting everything, how do you want to approach this?

Yeah, so I shared a Notion doc with you. I don't know if you saw it or not.

Oh, no, I did not. I'm so sorry.

No, no, it was minutes ago.

We prepared something. Yeah. Sometimes I get disappointed when people prepare things, even though it's the right thing, I'm very happy because then I'm like, oh, that means I just have to, I don't get to just like say whatever. No, I'm literally kidding.

I hope it's to navigate the conversation. No, absolutely. Yeah.

Let me pull up the Notion page. Oh, is it 327? Okay, it's not like you added me. No. Okay. Ooh, I love the framework. Okay.

Cool. So you're in that. Okay, great. So basically the idea is that this is kind of how I want to structure anything we kind of talk about. I think, you know, this CKO is around these ideas. I really like these principles quite a bit about kind of like how we're kind of like structuring ourself. All of this is up for like any, I'm not committed to any of this yet. It's just kind of more how we're thinking about it.

Yeah. But I kind of have the story arc down there, you know, that they, so this is kind of, this is as of right now, what I was thinking versus the CKO piece, but we can also stretch this out to the main stage too, if we want to. But kind of like this is how I want to kind of frame this is problem kind of what foundation we've done. I think those principles are important. We have to kind of have like guiding things for this.

Yeah. Yeah. Talk a little bit about what we've done so far. I think like, you know, Next Step Hygiene definitely has more of the AI like kind of, but Buying Groups was built, you know, kind of in a similar fashion. So kind of talking through those things and then laying out more of a cohesive vision kind of as the wrap up of it all. Yeah.

Super excited about this. This is really, really helpful. Oh, golly, thanks. What is these example?

What is, did you make slides?

Yeah. Yeah.

I made a video too.

No, you didn't. Okay, hold on. This is why I'm so excited for this meeting. Okay, hold on. Are we recording this? Yes. Okay, cool. I wanna make sure. The... Principles I love. Um... And The only thing I might want to add to it is like, I want to like... Yeah. How do I think about this? Like building with incrementality in mind. Like I want us to take big swings. There's like this thing where it's like we're going to do things and they're not going to land and then we'll iterate and build on top of it.

But it's like...

I feel like where a lot of people fail is that I was telling Julia this and I met with her.

It's like, this is a lot like learning a new instrument.

And like a lot of stuff you're going to suck for a while until you start to figure out the scales and things to be able to do it. And there's like this like... There's a, it's okay to make things and then be like, and then retire them. Right. You know, or not, or just, I don't know. There's, I don't know what the right. I think it's an evolution.

It's an evolution. It's not, it's not a thing that we're like, we're not.

It's not linear. We're going to do things that we're going to think and go down wrong turns and U-turn, but like ultimately the direction's the same and it's what we're trying to go.

Yeah. I get that. I think I can weave that in for sure. I like that.

Yeah. Who we're building for, I would think we're building for sales or real estate. I'm trying to think if that's even useful. I think what we're doing, we're building for... Like... we're building for unique roles, like whether your salesperson, implementation part of experience, like we're doing things that hopefully feel additive to your role and have that context of who you are, what your role is and what you're trying to do to better morph the UI and our commercial experience or we want to call it our AI system to you as a person.

Right. Yep. Yeah, that makes sense. I can evolve that more as well.

What I want to hear is what I want to make clear on is like this is you know important that we're this is fun to do this but it's only as good as it is useful like if it's just a bunch of flash yeah exactly but it's not like and then but like some of that feedback is great like when we did the initial email it like the feedback was like well it's easier to do in patchy bt you're like great then like what is that like heuristic or whatever that is like you know has to be easier than the default option yeah that right yeah like it has to become that easy for us to make this it's the only thing calling out to you like i mean like we're not saying Our goal is not to get you out of those things.

Our goal is to give you a more kind of like, you know, I think there's always going to be use cases for all these things, but at the same time, Like how do we make sure that we are also giving opportunities that are kind of more guided than just a raw prompt in an LLM? Sweet. I think roadmap is where we're probably the most murky as far as like where I think like kind of trying to figure out where we're going.

I know we've had different touches and things here and there, but I think it's still been a little like, let's go chase this and try. Let's go chase that.

Yeah.

But yeah.

It is pretty Bale-centric, which is fine. Yeah, I mean, I have one question where it's like, for PX, where does Plan Hat solve versus where do we eat? Like we're, that I don't know. And I think that's a question that would help us understand where we need to go from a guidance perspective. Yeah. I think, yeah, understanding the connection points between organizations would be helpful. So like this, like a new account planning interface to me, it seems like a very easy low hanging fruit thing for us to do and understanding like, okay, or maybe it's a new account.

I don't know, but something that helps like bring everyone together and start to surface things that are important holistically across all the stakeholders involved.

Yep.

Makes sense. Yeah. I think it's giving them different surfaces based on what they're, how we're kind of trying to orient their direction. That's a good point. I don't think we know enough about playing hat yet to know what it's really going to even doYeah, and figure out where we help with that.

I don't think we'll have the same level of customization ability that we'll have with Salesforce, just based on what I--No, I don't wanna touch plant hat. I think I want us to be our UI Salesforce first in my eyes and find out something that you can access. But I also, if we were to narrow this out, Some of these are components of the larger, some of these are building blocks that add up to its whole.

So when I think of next step hijacking and buying groups, these actually ladder up into what are unified sales homepages and how they look at all of their territory and being able to see things really easily. Those are the things.

And same with deal risk signals and deal intelligence and stuff like that.

Yeah.

Yeah. And that's kind of the story I'm telling with the slides so far is like, and I'll show you that also, but like kind of, let me see the slides first before we do that.

You're not sharing.

Yeah, okay, let me share my screen. Hold on.

We've been following that.

Well, I think we're jamming off the notion.

We're going off the notion page.

Let me get my slide up. Hold on. Okay, let's see. So this is a, these are like HTML5 animations.

Let's see, okay, here we go. Where did you used to build that? Clock code. They can build decks too.

They can build the slides. Let me get that. Hold on.

So that's effectively a webpage. Yeah. Sure. I need to get better at cloud code, Chris.

I don't know how to get it back onto my computer with the terminal and everything. We'll get it there. But basically the idea is like, and I'll let this go three for a sec and we can slow this down. It's kind of got like a timer on it.

I can't see anything yet.

Oh my gosh. How about you should not put me on stage if I can't do this right.

Oh, you'll go through Plastiev. Okay. Oh, cool. First of all, it's very nice. Yeah, I like it. Wait, hold on. Do you want me to comment on things?

Let me say this stuff. Hold on. Let me make sure. Okay. We're good now. Okay. Kind of like a little autoThere we go.

Okay. Know your deals before they slip.

Okay, I have a hot take here, which is I think deal signals and deal risks are a, like, no one's really solved this problem yet. Right. And it makes me nervous to try to tackle it.

Okay. That's fair.

The only reason is like... I think that we actually get some more foundational stuff in terms of the data inputs and everything else to make sure that you've got full coverage for us to really know.

'Cause the reality is we're piecing together 40% of what we know. Like we only get emails and hit bits and it's like, what's the actual thing?

That's fair. I think too, it does get risky 'cause no matter how you do that, you do get kind of eventually you get pretty generic on how your rating deals and they all have amounts. So I think that's fair. Yeah. For sure. Okay.

And like, because 80% could be like, yeah, I don't know. Anyways, keep going. That's fair. Yep, for sure.

So I kind of account health ideas, need attention, things like that. And some of this is kind of just like, I just kind of was working with it and said, let's make some ideas. None of this is like, yeah, I think we're up to stick with.

I think account health, I would like pivot to more like like you're like a better account homepage. So it's like account planning, account homepage structure where it's like, you know what's going on, you know who the buying group and the strength is.

You've got all signals in terms of new things that have happened in the market and what they're saying. You've got like, you're like kind of just like a new way to visualize all information.

Zach and I had kind of talked about this, which is like Salesforce does a terrible job of relaying account context back. So even it's like, Hey, here's a quick summary of the latest, account or here's what's changed in the last couple weeks or here are the new things like that to me i think would be really cool yep okay that's that's good So we have buying groups there.

We already, we got that. We can flesh this out further, I think as well on this front.

Yeah, the buying group stuff is really great. And I think where you're going with the scoring stuff, I think is like the thing that will push it really to be even more actionable as well.

One thing to you, all of this design is built with the Salesforce design system. So like, this is all, this is not like we can't do it. This is stuff that we actually achieve.

Oh really? Interesting. Yeah. That's cool. Yeah.

So yeah, next steps is already there.

We have a-Next episode, I think like, This is where we look at account, all these different pieces of the account and the opportunity kind of fit together in terms of chunks in my eyes. You've got the buying group, you've got the next steps, things to do, the action items. And then I think there's this other piece which you might have later, which is this orchestration layer. Like, hey, I need to send them an email.

I need to prep a meeting or exec doc.

It's all these things that we know how to get agents for.

How do you easily click it from that account and just generate what happens?

For sure. And like, here's, here's like concepts and ideas. We're also going to go show like, effectively what we're saying is kind of like record pages almost. So like, here's kind of actionable things on the page.

To me, it's like literally your account orchestration page. Basically you get this account, you can see everything else.

And from there you can launch and do things for the account itself. But it's like, okay, I'm going to build the ROI analysis for this. And it connects to that. I'm going to do the meeting handoff or I'm going to do an exact top sheet, or I'm going to do any of the other, the sales handoff that we talked about, or I want to send an email for this particular person. Like you can do all of that from like a launch pad right there.

Totally. Okay. Yep. Or I need to do a closed loss assessment or something.

Right. Okay, cool. And I liked this slide here just to kind of like centralize around different ideas. We can take off some of the ones we don't like from there. The meeting prep one is really cool.

I think that was really cool. um And to me, it's... Um Forecasting pipeline.

your account, health, meeting prep are all really strong ones. Yeah. Because to me, max step hygiene is part of the forecasting pipeline, kind of. Buying groups kind of go into account health. Yeah.

Okay. I, uh... then maybe the other one would be like, the other one's just like, how do you, like, it's just the activity you need to do.

So like, meeting crap is great, but then, hey, I need to action things.

What's next?

How do I, yeah, I think that's the big driver is like, and maybe that's what like, a deal intelligence is like, what's next or next best action or something.

I don't know how we want to think through it. That makes sense to me.

Yeah. And to be clear, I'm not, these are the nothing, I'm not committed. I'm just more like kind of getting ideas.

No, no, I literally am having the time of my life.

Okay, great.

And then it kind of brings in like the whole team as well too. Here also. So kind of like showing that. So I just will keep on going down that front for a second.

And I think that's what I was saying, we're gonna build roadmaps for the different roles that exist. Partner success or implementation or sales reps. So that's really great.

Yeah, so kind of like sales managers team at a glance. That kind of functionality there for them. you know, like the kind of servicing deals and that sort of thing.

Yeah, like for sales managers, I feel like we just rip off a lot of the stuff Clary has or some of the gone forecasting things that allow them to see trends over time and things that happen and what's going on. Right. Yeah.

Cool. Cool. And I think it was that forecasting stuff there as well on that front. So this kind of set ideas for that. SDR has got like, you know, kind of this idea of before you call kind of things. And so, I mean, this is getting a little bit pie in the sky here, I do like kind of still making sure we're calling out that role as part of this as well too.

Yeah. We only have two BDRs, so I don't want to over-index, but I do think the way that I would think about this is bridging the gap between sales and marketing. So how do we make it easy for us to action against new campaigns by like queuing up to a place where the BDR salesperson could each action to things that are very helpful for them in terms of making sure that they're doing it.

Totally. Okay. Yeah, I like that. It's like no prospects left behind situation. Totally. Oh yeah, deep account research instantly is really cool.

So to me, this ties into external signals. It ties into key moments, like all these things as well too. Yeah, totally. Maybe Brandon's wrong there. We can work on that.

Yeah, I'm going back a few of the slides to that. kind of look or it's like maybe the count centrals that we have but understanding key moments, modern events, all those other like things are helpful too.

Then this is kind of buying groups again, so not a big deal there. Yeah. And then partner success, like kind of some renew, I don't know how much we do at renewal and risk type stuff.

And this is where we just need to suss out what plan hat will do versus what For sure. Cool.

Yeah. And then kind of health score type stuff there, but also same plan hat. I think the same way as plan hat.

Yeah. Like see which, which is better in terms of doing it.

Um, can be helpful. There could be interesting ways to, yeah, we just have to think through.

I don't want to leave them out, but I also know that we're kind of like really investing heavily on plan hats going to be, you know, yeah.

And I don't know, and this is where Zach, I'm hoping you can help with Chris, just get a plug or just do some discovery on how they're thinking about using it. And like, okay, is implementation actually using plan hat or is it mostly partner success? You know, implementation right now tracks a lot of their thing on the implementation level. Is that going to move to plan hat? I don't know, but there's ways that can make it easier for them to.

It's just like, can I focus in on that? Planning idea and like surface that up here, kind of account planning.

Yeah, exactly. Like how the pilot's going, pilot risk, some of that stuff to help them think through, okay, this stuff is an active mobilization of my pilots that are going on a great way to view their kind of book of business. Yeah, totally.

And then lastly, kind of brings together the whole page here. Into this. And so ending with something like this, I can get different views as well. You know, is, is, is, could be good.

Yeah, this is where it's pretty cool because There's a lot of really cool things in terms of how we want to do this. It's crazy. Pipeline Health and book, that's a good, Pipeline Health is cool. because that can be Pipeline Health and also like your book of business health in terms of customer scoring, so they can see it. In terms of priority actions, yes, I can do that.

We have to think that there's a lot here and you think through.

Yeah, no, this is definitely just more kind of like this is idea generation.

What I really like is today's next schedule and then having a call like prep for the meeting or whatever, if there's something like that we can do. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

And more so, this is just a way just to kind of like give us a framework to kind of work back.

What I'm trying to, what I'm trying to, sorry, what I'm trying is like, how should we view an account, you know, like, okay, you have an account name, you click it, like, what should, like, come down as a part of that?

You know, what should that look like? It's like, okay, we've got some opportunities you can click into, you can see the buying group, you can see recent engagement with those folks or whatever that's happened.

I click on Metro, whatever this is, and it's all fake, then, like, it brings up some kind of thing of, like, a centralized...

Yeah, like, how should we, like, what's the actual best way to view, this is where it'd be so much more fun if we were in a room, like, what's the actual way to like view this um right Yeah, I know.

I mean, to me, it's almost like, I think we, I mean, this is just one piece of this system. And of course, like, I mean, we're not going to overhaul the entirety of like Salesforce in this, you know, like we will probably over time, but like, we're still going to still have the Salesforce experience as well tied into this, you know, so with like our kind of flavor on it from there. Yeah. And so I think, I mean, to me, there's always like, you can do modal type things or like you can even focus on an account record page view that can be helpful as well.

Yeah.

So the account central page of the account plan, but like an easy way for you to like view your territory or book, you can see all your accounts and then quickly like navigate the things that matter and reducing the clicks that you have to do to get there.

So, you know, you see your territory, typically what you would do is you'd have to click into the account, then on the account page and you need to find the contact or find the right opportunity, then you gotta click into that to see everything. It's like, what do we, how do we like see everything really easily where you can just like see those things.

Yeah. Which I think is a cooler way for us to think through as well.

And then just like an easy...

Yeah, and there's probably ways where, yeah. Those are my heads going.

Yeah, that's really helpful. I think that, 'cause to me, I feel like, you know, this to me is like what I've showed you, and whenever we get where we want it to go, it's kind of like the video we play, kind of what we do are kind of spiel and do kind of our thing, and then we kind of like show where we're going. You know, and to me, this is like where we're going. We kind of like, what we've done, kind of how we're thinking about it, like that's the principle's idea.

Yeah, I mean, we're basically taking over the UI Salesforce to build something that is Salesforce but completely bespoke to what we want it to be.

Exactly, so it's kind of like, you know, but we couldn't do that without the data work we did last year in buying groups. We couldn't do, I mean now it's like we established principles to know why we're doing what we're doing. And then the kind of like, you know, we have the data source and like the foundation of that matters about how we structure those pieces matter. And it's like, if we do all that right, this is where we could end up at from there.

Totally. And like other things I have in my mind is like, how do we serve reps up with the latest, like latest new things that marketing has put together or things that are happening or like call their attention to stuff.

So like when you do like, Hey, I want to send someone an email. It's like, it says here, the content things that we suggest based on the person. We wouldn't have the ability to actually create this UI related part of it.

It would just like generate the email as a result.

But it's kind of crazy to think there's like, you could generate some email and be like, here's some content, like which content do you feel like is the best one?

You click it and then it can like then serve the final thing. It's just kind of crazy to think through. Absolutely. All that works. Totally. In terms of This is where we need to think through... The only thing that's missing is...

This is what you're right.

Our goal is this new UI orchestration layer that we're building. To get there, we've had to have the foundations of data. And we started to build these building blocks on it. Like... what is the like where do we want what's the one like where is the Lego we want to stack now?

And we feel like we're most prepared to execute based on what we have right now. I think it's this account centric thing that allows you to have the buying groups, the next step hygiene, the orchestration in terms of like hitting the agents that we have existing today. To me, that one is like in the account plan, like that one feels most universal that we are primed to do today.

What do you think?

It's viewed more like an account-centric type view.

Yeah, let's start with the account and then we can click it up.

Because we can't really do the homepage yet until we solve what the account should look like. Because that will then give us signals to how do we then extract one level up.

To me, it's layering into, yeah, it's like NextApp is definitely buying groups. It's definitely kind of like trying to almost like, I mean, right now our layout is so field-heavy today and so many of it's very chunky and listless. And it's like, yeah, how do we have a section for commercials? That's what's happened commercially, you know, section for how.

Yeah. Or just like, hey, here's the quick Twitter version of the latest that's happened on the account based on what we can see or like, you know, because we don't have Slack groups anymore, Slack channels on it.

like this is where you go. It can almost be cool if there's a place where it's like you point people to it and they can ask like, hey, I want to ask the PSD something on it and they can just on Salesforce there that suits.

Yeah. Slack off, you know.

Right. It can't even be the launch, like the front door to an account page. I know that's, Zach doesn't like that idea. But, I don't know. I don't know, just take me there. I'm thinking through on the account page how we then link to, if we're going to move away from Pitch and it'll be in Google Drive, like we can link to some of the things that are there in terms of the documentation set up if it happens.

You can...

I mean, to me, also enablement, like an ambulance making great content and great material, like how do we also synthesize that in a helpful way as well too?

Well, I mean, we can then start to compare what this person's seen or not seen as well, but... there are key moments that we might want to track by the count to and then become customers.

Like, last time we think they've seen a roadmap. Or like, last...

I don't know. I need to...

Yeah, I could probably do that, but there's... I just wish I... Maybe tomorrow, like, try to, like, put something up in the office tomorrow. Okay.

And that probably... I think that probably needs to be in the roadmap. Chris's, like, rotten event slash key moment tracking. Yeah, I think that's a good one, because that'll be great.

I mean, some of that's in PlanHat, but I think this is more universal.

Because we, yeah. Um, Like... I just think of this account part being like the launch point. It's like, hey, I want to like launch to this Sigma dashboard that corresponds to this account and like go there. Like there's just great like... I don't know. That's kind of what I'm thinking. Because then you go to accounts, spit up an ROI model or spit up a custom landing page or figure it. I don't know, visualizing this, like, hey, what do you want?

what do you want to do with the account and the captions or, you know, meeting exact pop sheets or, Hey, I just need an exact summary and what's happening with this one, or we need to do a sales handoff or, I want to email Right, right.

Yeah. So it's kind of like, it's like information context, also actions, also like external external system resources. Sigma.

Yeah. Yeah.

I mean, that might be future stuff, like not super critical, but you know, yeah. That's kind of what's in my head. Okay.

Yeah, I think I can take that. That's helpful. It's very helpful. This is, yeah, because me, it's like, this is a couple of me, of course, we're trying to like do a great presentation at CKO, but also we need to deliver on these things and also plan out what we're going to do.

I think if we could show a mock-up of an account structure plan, like thing, like account homepage thing, like to me, that's the goal that I have. It's like, Hey, this is our vision.

And here's, here's the new, here's our current date, like an alpha of this new account structure.

And this one, I focused on roles and different things. This is more like we're all centering, everyone's gonna interact with this page.

And so--Yeah, this is more of being like, this is now the official account page for a bridge.

And so we're not aggregating back on kind of this like, look at my stuff across, this is more like, let's dial into what--That's coming soon.

Let's think about building blocks, right?

It's like, we can't nail, if we don't have the account structure of like how we're visualizing everything, we don't know how to then build one like above.

The same way that we didn't have bind groups, it wouldn't be as powerful to do that.

I feel like we now have the capability to make this new account page based on everything.

Okay, and so really that's the goal is to kind of show, tease that as the end of the process.

Because then it's easy.

You don't have to go to Slack and be like, add attention bot, whatever. You can just go there and do it. You know what I mean? That's pretty cute in terms of it being nice. Yeah, I should try that in there. That would be cool to show that.

That's what you should do. And then also the new request process for how you can add that as a bot. It's like, hey, we want a solution design or whatever it's going to be. You can do all that. That kind of page. Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah, once we get that in place, yeah, absolutely. Okay. Cool. This is super helpful. I think this helps me get me out of like macro to more kind of like-Yeah, I think the way that we should, and I think this goes back to our principles is like, we haven't earned the right yet to get the homepage.

You know what I mean? It's like we got to earn the right by getting the principles down first so that we'd be able to go one up. And Zach, when we were on site, he's like, I want to do a new forecasting thing.

I'm like, I think you could do that, but it seems really hard.

Like, I don't know if we've earned the right yet to do it. We can try. We should take big swings and see what happens because I don't think without big swings we can't push our limits, but I don't know.

Well, the good thing is once we can establish an account page, then that's pretty easy to bleed that into other objects too because then it's like...

Correct. I think we'll cascade that down in similar ways.

It's like, okay, now this is just the opportunity version of it or whatever is going on.

Okay. This is awesome. I'm thinking that could be really helpful for PX.

Truthfully, it's managing the people who need to opt in to certain pages and shit, like the status page and the communication stuff, making that easier to edit and modify. That could be a really nice loading fruit thing just to make that experience easier for them. Zach, I don't know what you think about that.

What is it?

You know how, like, rep that people add their contacts to, like, who should get...

Poms and who should get Oh yeah kind of like the bunny group thing Correct a version of like that but I mean I do want to like It's a little bit different But that's something that can be really great for. And I agree.

I mean, like, taking on key use cases and say, we're solving for this here. It's not just like, great, it looks pretty. It's like, there's also useful components of this as well. Yeah, because that could be really cool.

And you might want even, like, if there's a PSD who knows that really well, I can ask around too. And then maybe you can just be like, what would an amazing experience be for you?

And then mock up something really quickly. It could be really sweet. Yeah. Well, they probably say do it for me.

But in lieu of that. But, like, right now you have to, like, go into each contact. It's, like, such a pain in the ass to do it.

It's a little better than that. Initially, but it still is a pain.

But if you can do it all on one screen. Yeah. Yeah, a couple screens. That'd be really cool. Like, the good mantra, I... They taught us this when I was in my education classes in college.

It's like... When you build an assignment, it has to be helpful, right? So they would call anything that is not helpful but looks good a hand turkey. And it was this idea that you would always trace your hand around Thanksgiving and then make a turkey. But it's like, why? So it was a huge waste of time for kids to do the thing. And so we could make that mantra, no hand turkeys, in terms of what we're building and what we're driving.

For sure. Yeah. For sure. Because I think it's easy just to surface information, like this looks pretty-is that helpful? And principle-wise, and you could go back to this, My mantra is always like... What are we doing that we have to do? It's a pain in the ass and takes time. Those are the perfect things to replicate. I think the communication topics are like the status page stuff is a great example of that.

There's no simple way to do that and we over automate it. There's a lot of risk on the other side.

You just got to make it easier to execute. Yeah. The needle there.

Right. Yeah, I'm with you. This is awesome. I really appreciate the help you're getting. I mean, I wanted to kind of get like around a conceptual idea and I think we're aligned there. But then like I think the meat and potatoes is where we need to kind of fill in the gaps. Yeah.

We don't have to go too far ahead for this presentation. We can lay that out for ourselves. Yeah. I don't think people have a pick. It's a really short roadmap.

No. Seriously, we have like five minutes, five to seven minutes for this.

Yeah, so it's going to be quick.

I think it's going to be quick.

You get bumped up to the big stage. You get bumped up to the big stage, but then there are other things. But if we could have a mock-up for an account page and then maybe the communication preferences thing, that would be huge. I think it would be standing ovation.

Are you okay with the personess aesthetically?

Oh, yeah, of course. Bye. Great. I'm not that, yeah.

I like the... The colors, I get to pick the colors.

Yeah, so. I used the abridged brain colors for this.

I showed Julia, who was also just like so confused because of the way it is native, so it's hard to even suss out, like it's almost, it's just so unfathomable to me that we're able to do anything like this.

I just can't get over it.

Kind of what? Remember Squid? Yeah. Like, that's what they would do, but it was a huge pain in the ass. Like, at Career Builder, we had whole teams on Squid.

I know. It's just, it's really fucking crazy. It's really, really crazy.

Well, I think, too, like, people, they never did a good job of it, like, showing that what, like, you never ever really saw a better version of what Salesforce than what you just always knew. You know, and I think, like, to me, it's, I don't know why they didn't push those things harder than that, you know, there.

Or you would get, like, totally Frankenstein-ed for shit's sake. Yeah. too far the other direction. This is like, you're still staying within the construct. And maybe that's something you talk about too, is like, you kind of brought up like, you know, the foundation building or like earning the right to do X, Y, Z. Like you can talk about stuff we did.

And I was like, that is a thing that's got to earn the right to automate a little bit.

And to do that, we had to like, get our emails lined up correctly.

Yeah, there's so much guts work that...

Get all the calls in a format that made sense. Attention calls. Yeah.

Yeah. Okay. This is a ton of great stuff. I can get back to the drawing board with this and come back to you. I know you'll be out next week, Zach, but I can get this back to you, Jeremy.

Yes, Chris, whatever you need. I'm fairly flexible this week.

And then do you know, just so I can kind of start thinking, if I do go to the main stage thing, what does that look like? Is that 30 minutes for me?

No, no, no, no. It would be like five minutes. It's a similar thing. It might be both. I don't know. If it's the main stage, I might have you to show,Just show how you, it might be more like, what I've heard is that like Shiv, then go up and kind of explain how he does it and everything else. I think it's important for people... The thing that's so hard about this is that it's, there is a sunk cost of getting set up.

Like, and it's still hard.

Like, I don't know how to go back and do it, but like, either you or Brad going on stage and being like, here's actually how I did the thing. Here's the guts of how it all worked. This is helpful for people to think through.

I chose VS Code because it talks to Salesforce easily.

Yeah, and I can literally drop in a photo of what I wanted. It's pretty crazy to think through how that all works. And even like... But maybe we even, as an example, come up with a stupid use case that you show live.

It's like, here, this is how quick it takes to stand up something that's like this.

Right. Yeah. I think one thing you and I have been doing is we'll talk. I'll take what we talked about and go do it. I think using that too can be helpful. We have a lot of conversations, and it's easy to take that conversation and kind of talk about it.

Maybe we do it together. It's like, hey, I'm going to show Jeremy this conversation. We're going to talk about it, and then I'm going to go feed this transcript back into it. And we should kind of play around with that.

Wow, I've never seen your dog before.

He's going nuts. I took her out of the situation.

Archie's been such a bad boy today. Actually, that's not true. It's the parking. Cool. Thank you guys. This is great. Really, really stoked about this. Great because of what you've done. Well, yeah, Chris, seriously.

I mean, it's just, it's just, I mean, it was my minor time. I do it too. So I'm still like, Oh, is my, my draw drops all day long.

I just like, don't it's, it's like one of those things where it's like hard to explain people that don't understand. Yeah. Um, And I have trouble even processing it.

too just because of like we were all together six months ago and this wasn't possible right I think we'll hear a lot.

I think we'll probably hear a lot of that around when the Opus model came out, how that changed. I feel like what we've seen in Slack as far as just community-wise since that point is a different approach than it was before. Because now it's like, Shiv is pointing to these major engineering leaders who are like, I don't like code anymore. And I think we're seeing definitely a vibe shift heavily to that.

Yeah.

From there. Yeah. I mean, they have a reason to say that. Yeah. But yes, we see it ourselves.

Well, I think the narrative change from this is kind of cool to this is fundamentally changing this industry. You know?

Yeah, from novelty to, like, impact has changed, I think. Or people are, like, now...

I mean, it's just crazy to think that we have something in production that was entirely vibe-coded. Like, that's a crazy concept for me to get past in that time frame.

I got her in here.

Because even the summer, he had to build that entirely new Objects and stuff, manually, if you even get that stuff. Working.

Yeah, but the split... The big thing to me, Chris and I have talked a lot about this, is like... We have combined that with like... API orchestration essentially to make it functionally work on production. And so you had to have a background there plus this front end stuff that we didn't have a background on to like plug it all together like So for example, like with Brad's thing, if the next step was drawing Salesforce data, like...

there's a unique piece there, I think, that, like, we're positioned pretty well to do. Yeah. Yeah. Historical, like, declarative work. And that, to me, is, like, the, for you, Chris, like, the secret sauce is, like, versus, like, you read on LinkedIn about someone making themselves, like, a personal app.

Yeah. To me, I guess, yeah.

I just don't even believe that they're doing that. I do.

I mean, but, like, it's, like, they're just plugging into, like, some basic things. And they might have integrations, but, like, it's not business performance. like this is for us because we have this like already existing experience.

you know we've like wished we could do the rest of this for a long time and now we're kind of like it's unlocking like to me that's the big picture yeah i mean it's like it's having trey it's having a partner in trey too that like lets us keeps us on top of what's happening there you know in a helpful way also and then it's leaning into all the different attention giving us basically the keys to the castle like theoretically like gong would never do that because they know that it diminishes and that's the other question I have is we've worked on those y'all have established really firm relationships there and we've we have to step on those all the time and they're pretty awesome yeah I think we could have done this with Cullen for what it's worth like you think so yeah I've heard I've talked to the Datadog people who are evaluating intention.

And they were like, Gronk doesn't let us do any type of querying beyond just accounts right now in production.

I mean, like, apparently very much like, I'm a, hey, help me get an MCP. And he's like, he's like, yeah, when do you want it? It's like, literally, it's like, you know, it's that.

Yeah. Yeah. I just meant like the conversation structure and stuff that already existed. But sure. Yeah.

Yeah. Wearing against it.

Yes. We do need to get made a heads up. Like he needs to, like, the only thing I fear is that if we don't help our trade going away, it would be really bad. I don't, not saying they're going to go away, but I don't know what to replace. And I feel like, how do we help?

the people that have been helpful to us.

Because we've had to tell them no a lot on like marketing things. We've had to tell them no, like, hey, I can't say yes to this stuff and that sort of thing. You know, so to me... Oh, you should.

Ask like that to me and I can get stuff.

I can... get good at making it a exception.

I think it'd be worthwhile to talk to them and be like, hey, and this guy Tom, I've talked to some there too. Let's do something together. I think it would be helpful to them because I think we're Yeah, you're right. I mean, like, Workato might could do it, but I don't know enough. You know, I'll use that for a long time. But it's like this still is more flexible than Workato is right now.

I do think there's something cool. We have to figure out how. My dream would be that we actually invite innovative other companies together and do a day of actual hacking together on some of this stuff. And like, okay, let's all as a group...

you know, whatever companies like reimagine the Salesforce UI totally doing this and just like spend some time thinking through all these different things can be a really cool thing.

Right. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. Yeah. For sure. I don't know. Okay. It's just so crazy. It is.

It's just so crazy. I feel like, I just feel kind of like there's this realms well happening too that like we're about to, is this gonna keep on, like I think doing this now and establishing these, Foundations is really important. Like what we're talking about today.

The question I have is like how, like if you're a point solution within Salesforce, I think you're in deep shit.

Deep, deep shit.

and like the messaging on linkedin that i'm seeing from salesforce is like look i can now do flows i can it's like it's no one still it's really it's no it's it's not the right it's not the right thing and i don't know they're like yeah i mean we saw it firsthand they were like weed with agent force but the reality is like we're gonna lock you into like data cloud bullshit so that and charging per run i mean like i don't know to me it's just like you That's where trade has done well.

We'll charge you for our structure, but we're talking to OpenAPI directly. So we're not passing that through. Those costs are separate.

Um Yeah, it's no different than any other cost we would have incurred with them.

This is where I keep going.

It's like, either I need to short Salesforce or buy Salesforce, and I have no idea because I don't know. Like... Either they're going to figure their shit out. I just...

I think the tale is still so long. I think there's a million companies that are using Salesforce who would never do this.

No, they will never, ever do it.

But the problem I have with Salesforce right now is that agent force is so confusing. I still don't understand what it is. I still cannot explain what agent force is. To anyone, I don't know. They couldn't. My understanding is that basically it's an agent that could respond to support tickets. It's basically what I understand it to be.

And then when the flows, like I had this summer, I was a very technical salesperson.

I think flows was one of the worst sales forces they ever did because it was so confusing. That's a hot take that I have. I think it's better for people like you.

I think it's better for people for you and stuff because it's more flexible. But from a cost of ownership perspective, it's so high because it's so not like it's very confusing. It was very confusing.

It's basically a tool to introduce developer concepts into a non-developer audience. And it's like.

And like is agent force like to create flows from custom language? I don't know. Maybe. I don't know.

I think agent force is all orchestrated by flows. So I think. I don't really know. I don't know.

Like you have to create a flow to kick off. It's very confusing like how that.

I really don't. Yeah.

The other thing about Salesforce too is, which I guess is crazy to me, they make more money off Service Cloud than Sales Cloud. And to me, a Service Cloud type entity is ripe for disruption more so than Sales Cloud.

And Service Cloud is one of the worst products I've ever seen.

It is horrible.

The entire thing is horrible. Yeah. And I actually think you could build a service cloud UI. I think you could... Totally do that. So the question is, do they then shut off access?

Like if sales first move, then they become a walled garden.

Um. I don't know if they'll figure out I don't know. How would Salesforce monetize the work that we're doing? they could switch up their pricing structure to... Great dates for deployments, basically, which would be nuts.

Well, yeah, or they charge you for code.

Because, I mean, on the developer side, they're a pretty open organization. They have a lot of great shit out there for people who are developers.

Yeah. That was the stance that always happened, but that could be their downfall because people might not need any of their other things.

They think they're going to win by gating slack. It's really, it's like, I'm rebuilding y'all's, your AI. You don't even really.

Yeah. You're, you're, you're on the, you're on the wrong end. You sold your stupid slack contract, but.

We're up to 4% of code used in APEC.

And that's the other thing. It was like one. When people figure it out, it's going to be so fast, I don't know what they'll be able to do. I mean, they could basically start to be like, hey, it's a security risk to do that, but I don't even think it is a security risk because you could do all this today anyways.

Yeah, I mean, I think as long as you're– that's what I've always been trying to do is like use the tools they give you to analyze this from a security standpoint, make sure that it passes those sniff tests. Yeah. And then that way you feel like you're not just like, They might not even know.

They would never know what you built is five COVID. Yeah. Yeah.

That's so crazy. For sure.

Yeah, even before this. They don't review code, right? Like, we could have...

I guess, what does Salesforce lose if you read...

I'm just like, oh, am I putting a Tim Kaff on? What does Salesforce lose if you reimagine their UI?

They get less... they could... I don't think they lose anything. It's the halo effect.

Yeah, they still use the sales factor. You're still getting people to use it. It actually helps them because they can spend less money on content and product stuff, which they're really bad at.

and more on backend infrastructure, which they're a little bit better at. Yeah.

Well, yeah, I always tell everybody, like, at the end of the day, it's just a related database.

It's just a database. A spreadsheet with a million types.

Yeah. With a lot of like easy joy and ability.

Maybe they are going to kill Salesforce. Maybe their, their view is that they become Slack first as the main delivery client. I don't think that's that. I don't, I think most people don't like Slack.

I don't think they realize that, which is like actually Slack is...

become corrupted. Yeah.

I'm sure engage is not going or whatever the thing we elevate. Yeah. Yeah. Can't wait to turn that product. Well, they told me you're going to love this. They were like, oh, you can't really churn it because you just got to upgrade all your slack and then you're going to have it. to have the other features that we have on the IT side. I don't know. It's going to be included.

Then we'll get that money back.

So it's still churn. Well, they're going to make us bump on the... All the slack licenses, not just the whatever we bought.

Well, the slack is not my problem.

No, not at all. Yeah, our budget will.

We are, but I don't give a shit about you and Slack.

-I told Chris about our saga with them. Oh, I've... I have the meanest.

I was so fucking pissed at whatever the guy's name was. Yeah, they almost were like, they play like tone deafness to their advantage sometimes. So they're just like, we're just gonna keep on pushing it. I don't know.

I slapped their hand on that. They need it. slap their face a little bit. That's fine. Bye. All right.

Well, I'm going to see my family for the first time in seven days. I'm pumped.

Yeah. That's going to be great.

I still got to have a little bit of distance, but I'm excited to see them all. Oh, you do?

Are you feeling okay? I feel totally fine this entire time.

You're back home right now. I'm back home. I came home this morning. And so I've got to do like a scan tomorrow to make sure all that went okay.

But I feel I felt fine. I just got to like really for my three-year-old, like I can't hold him for like hours. Basically, just like keeping him in mind.

But not, I mean, At a time, you mean?

Yeah, he can't lay in the bed together or cuddle, that kind of thing. But really, by tomorrow, I'm kind of clear assist tonight. That's interesting. Yeah. It's that radiation half-life, man. Right. Keeps on chopping us up in half over time.

So crazy. I'm really glad for you. Are you hopefully just taking the day off to be with family tomorrow?

I'll do the half day of the morning and I'll do that from there. So, yeah.

Zach, are you coming to the office tomorrow?

Yeah, I'll be there. Great.

It will be fun. Were you on my commercial? delivery of the comp plan stuff for you it was okay they're gonna that's the hardest one I think for meYeah, but like, That team has the most care of promotion. Yeah, I think it's going to be fine. There's a little like...

Here at Strategic, like sales-wise, there's nowhere else to go, at least at this company, right? And so for that team, there's like a double whammy of like, oh, you can move up. and get this guy. We're not gonna talk about that in that meeting, but there's a little background to that.

I think that's a little different.

But yes, I thought it was fine.

I'm going to jump, guys. Good to see you. I'll work on this more. Cool. Enjoy the family. I'm going to jump, guys. Good to see you. I'll work on this more. Cool. Enjoy the family. Thanks. See you. Bye.

# RevOps Showcase: Where We're Going

**Session:** Sales/Marketing/RevOps Breakout (Wednesday)
**Format:** Pre-recorded video walkthrough (everything must be pre-recorded)
**Audience:** Commercial team

---

## The Focus

Account Page is the centerpiece. "Where we're going."

Main Stage = how we got here. This session = where we're headed.

---

## What to Show

1. **Account Page walkthrough** — the main event (pre-recorded video of mockup)
   - Full-page layout, header, AI summary
   - Buying groups with engagement criteria
   - Orchestration panel — click-through modals
   - Sigma dashboard, Google Drive, account plan links
   - Mutual action plan, "chat with this account"
2. **Engagement criteria** — the evolution of Next Steps (don't rehash Next Steps itself)
3. **Status Page reimagined** — project teams management widget (like buying group modal)
4. **Shout out Ramon** — help requests reimagination

## What NOT to Show
- Don't rehash Next Steps — it's been shown, show what's next instead

## Files

| File | What |
|------|------|
| `presentation.html` | The presentation (needs update for new direction) |
| Screenshots | Reused from main_stage where applicable |

## Framing

- "Here's where we're going"
- Account Page as the reimagined Salesforce experience
- "We're inventing new UI" — this has never been done before
- Show click-throughs even if output isn't built yet
- End with the vision: account → opportunity → contact → territory

# AI Charter & Roadmap
## GTM Systems | Revenue Kickoff 2026

# The Challenge

---

## The Problem

Reps do a lot of work. Calls, emails, meetings, research, follow-ups.

But that work doesn't *accumulate* anywhere useful.

Every time a rep opens a deal, they're mentally reconstructing:
- Where were we?
- What did we discuss?
- Who else is involved?
- What should I do next?

The work is happening. The context isn't connecting.

---

## The Opportunity

We have a platform we can build anything on.

AI changes what's possible.

What if there was a surface that was always gathering context from across every interaction — and always ready to guide?

Not another dashboard. Not another report.

A system that *knows* and *suggests* — because it's been watching all along.

---

# Our Charter

---

## GTM Systems AI Vision

> **Build an always-on intelligence layer that gathers context from every rep interaction and turns it into guidance at the moment of need.**

Not AI for AI's sake.
AI that makes the work you've already done work *for* you.

---

## The Principles

**1. Foundation First**
AI is only as good as the data it has access to.

**2. Meet People Where They Work**
Sales lives in Salesforce. Partner Success lives in Planhat. The intelligence layer extends across the ecosystem.

**3. Context, Not Complexity**
Surface the right information at the right moment — don't overwhelm.

**4. Anticipate, Don't Ask**
The best systems know what you need before you search for it.

**5. Evergreen Insights**
Always current. Always relevant. Self-healing.

---

# Who We're Building For
## The Commercial Team

---

## Start With the Job

This charter serves the full commercial organization.

Before we build, we listen: what are you actually trying to do? What gets in your way?

---

## Sales

**Core question:** "What should I do next?"

Juggling dozens of deals. Context switching constantly. Rebuilding mental state before every call.

**The opportunity:** Surface the right context at the right moment — so you spend time selling, not searching.

---

## Partner Success

**Core question:** "Which accounts need me?"

Managing a full book. Watching for signals. Often reactive instead of proactive.

**The opportunity:** See risk early. Know where to focus. Intervene before problems escalate.

---

## Leadership

**Core question:** "Where do I coach?"

Limited time. Incomplete data. Can't go deep on every deal.

**The opportunity:** Visibility into what actually needs attention — based on evidence, not gut feel.

---

## Supporting Teams

Enablement. Operations. Deal Desk. The teams that make the commercial engine run.

**The opportunity:** Better data. Cleaner processes. Insights that help you help the field.

---

## The Design Principle

> **We're not building "AI features." We're helping specific people do their specific jobs better.**

---

# Building the Foundation
## 2025: Before You Can Run, You Have to Walk

---

## The Data Problem

AI needs context. Our systems had data, but it was:

- **Fragmented** — CRM, email, calls, docs in silos
- **Incomplete** — missing stakeholder relationships
- **Inaccessible** — locked in formats AI can't use

2025 was about fixing this.

---

## Buying Group Data Model

**The question:** Who are the stakeholders? How engaged are they?

**What we built:**
- Custom objects to track personas and roles
- Engagement scoring across touchpoints
- Relationship visibility at the opportunity level

> *"You can't coach on relationships you can't see."*

---

## Email Activity Sync

**The question:** Who's talking to whom?

**What we built:**
- Weflow integration syncing every email to Salesforce
- Activity history connected to contacts and opportunities
- Full communication timeline at your fingertips

> *"Now we know the conversation history."*

---

## Conversation Intelligence

**The question:** What's actually happening on calls?

**What we built:**
- Attention integration: recordings + transcripts synced to deals
- MEDDPICC signals extracted automatically
- Searchable, actionable call data

> *"Every call becomes data we can learn from."*

---

## The Foundation Thesis

> **"AI is only as good as the data it has access to. 2025 was about building the data foundation. 2026 is about putting AI to work on top of it."**

Buying Groups + Email + Calls = The context AI needs to help.

---

# AI Comes Online
## 2026: The Foundation Pays Off

---

## Revenue Intelligence — My Pipeline

**The headline:** AI-powered insights for every rep, right where they work.

This is the first major application of the foundation.

---

## What Reps See

**Deal Insights**
AI synthesis: "Here's where this deal stands and what needs attention."

**Risk Signals with Evidence**
Not just a score — the *why* behind the risk.

**Buying Group at a Glance**
Who's engaged. Who's cold. What roles are missing.

**Next Steps, Surfaced**
The system anticipates what you should do next.

---

## The Shift

Before: Reps dig through activities to rebuild context.

After: The context is already assembled. The guidance is already there.

> **Your past work becomes your current advantage.**

---

# What Becomes Possible
## The Architecture Compounds

---

## The Pattern

Every data source we connect becomes fuel for the next capability.

The foundation doesn't just enable one feature — it enables a **platform**.

These aren't hypotheticals. Companies are already doing this. The question is how we apply proven patterns to our foundation.

---

## For Sales: Context on Demand

**The problem:** Rebuilding mental state before every interaction. 30 minutes of research, or walking in cold.

**What's possible:**
- Before every meeting, a brief appears: recent emails, call highlights, stakeholder context
- When you open a deal, the next best action is already surfaced
- The system watches engagement patterns: "This deal went quiet," "New stakeholder added"

**The shift:** From searching to selling. The context finds you.

---

## For Partner Success: Early Warning

**The problem:** By the time you know an account is at risk, it's often too late.

**What's possible:**
- Usage drop-off flagged before it becomes churn
- Key contacts going silent surfaced early
- Renewal risk visible with time to act
- Insights surfaced in Planhat, where you already work

**The shift:** Intervene early. Prevent fires instead of fighting them.

---

## For Leadership: Coaching Visibility

**The problem:** Limited time. Can't go deep on every deal. Relies on self-reporting.

**What's possible:**
- Deals that need attention flagged automatically
- Stakeholder coverage gaps surfaced
- Forecast confidence based on actual engagement, not gut feel

**The shift:** Coach where it matters most. Evidence over anecdote.

---

## For Everyone: Enablement in Context

**The problem:** Great content exists. It lives in a portal no one visits.

**What's possible:**
- Battlecards surface when a competitor is mentioned
- Objection handling appears at the right moment
- Coaching materials relevant to *this* deal, *this* stage

**The shift:** Enablement finds you. Not the other way around.

---

## The Vision

We're not trying to put AI in every corner.

We're building a **self-updating intelligence layer** — where context is always current, insights are always relevant, and the next step is always clear.

> **The work you've done becomes the guidance you need.**

---

# The Journey

## The Mindset

We're not committing to a feature list.

We're committing to a **direction**:

> Build an intelligence layer that continuously gathers context from rep activity and surfaces guidance at the moment it's needed.

The foundation is built. The first application is live. The architecture compounds from here.

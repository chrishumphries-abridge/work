# ALCO Main Stage: How I Use AI

## Overview
5-minute talk at All-Company (ALCO) kickoff showcasing how a non-engineer uses AI to build real tools. Part of Jeremy's showcase proving commercial team knows how to "AI pill."

## Key Details
- **Event**: ALCO Main Stage
- **Audience**: 500 people (entire company)
- **Duration**: 5 minutes
- **Format**: Apple keynote style, Jeremy as MC
- **Status**: Pending exec approval (Sarah confirming)

## The Evidence (Real Numbers)

| Metric | Amount |
|--------|--------|
| Apex code written | 53,508 lines |
| LWC JavaScript | 63,673 lines |
| SFDX projects | 30+ |
| Working mockups | 22 |
| Custom Claude skills | 10 |
| Tray workflows | 8+ |

### Major Systems Built
1. **Revenue Intelligence / My Pipeline** — AI-powered sales dashboard (production)
2. **Buying Group Components** — Multiple LWC versions (production)
3. **Commercial Segment Approvals** — Tray + Slack workflow
4. **VA Intel Slack Digest** — 6 workflows, 3 layers
5. **Territory Home Page** — In development
6. **Custom Skills** — Daily planning, meeting processing, impact analysis

## Logistics Needed
- [ ] Walk-on music (5 seconds as you walk to stage)
- [ ] Better headshot (not badge photo)
- [ ] Slides in Abridge template
- [ ] Revenue Intelligence screenshot (production UI)
- [ ] Account Page mockup (the reveal)

## The Story Arc

```
0:00 - HOOK: "I'm not an engineer. But this year I built 53K lines of code."
0:45 - OLD WAY: Boxed in by Salesforce, waiting for dev resources
1:15 - UNLOCK: Found Claude Code, built Revenue Intelligence in a week
2:15 - WHAT I'VE BUILT: Buying Groups, Approvals, VA Intel, 22 mockups
3:15 - BEYOND CODE: Daily planning, meeting processing, how I actually work
4:00 - INVITATION: Line disappearing, you don't need to code
4:30 - CLOSE: Start small, tools are ready
```

## Key Message
Personal journey showing the VARIETY of work AI enables — not just code, but thinking, admin work, integrations, prototypes. Honest about limitations: engineers review everything, still learning, sometimes feels like cheating.

## Audience Reality
- ~50% engineers who know these tools already
- ~50% non-technical folks who think "I could never build anything"
- **The talk is FOR the second group**, not the first
- Engineers will likely appreciate that ops can now prototype without waiting for them

## Handling Anxiety
The slides include:
- Direct acknowledgment to engineers ("I know I'm not one of you")
- Emphasis on code review and learning from feedback
- Honest admission ("I sometimes feel like I'm cheating")
- Prepared responses for engineer pushback

This vulnerability makes the talk stronger, not weaker.

## If This Gets Cut
The real numbers and "how I work now" content can strengthen either:
- CKO 5-min talk (add personal journey angle)
- CKO AI Foundations (add "proof it works" section)

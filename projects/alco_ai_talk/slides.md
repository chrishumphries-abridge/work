# ALCO Main Stage: How I Use AI
## 5-Minute Talk

# I'm Not an Engineer

I can't write code from scratch.

Never could.

---

# But Here's What I Do Now

Write Apex classes.
Build Salesforce flows.
Create custom Lightning components.
Design Slack integrations.
Prototype entire features.

All with AI.

---

# Let Me Show You The Range

---

# Type 1: Planning & Thinking

After every stakeholder conversation,
I feed the transcript to Claude.

"What did I miss?"
"What are the real priorities?"
"Turn this into an architecture doc."

AI helps me think, not just do.

---

# Type 2: Salesforce Admin Work

Building flows. Creating fields.
Setting up validation rules.

I describe the business logic.
AI writes the metadata.
I review and deploy.

---

# Type 3: Code I Couldn't Write Before

Apex classes. LWC components.
Test classes with 90% coverage.

Real production code.
Reviewed by engineers.
Shipped.

---

# Type 4: Integrations

Tray.io workflows. Slack Block Kit.
API specs. Webhook handlers.

Things that used to require
a developer, a spec, and 3 weeks.

Now: a conversation and an afternoon.

---

# Type 5: Prototypes

22 working mockups.

Account pages. Deal cards.
Manager dashboards. PS views.

Each started as: "What if it looked like this?"

---

# Type 6: My Own Productivity

**Morning:** "Plan my day"
→ Aggregates Asana, Calendar, Notion

**After meetings:** "Process this transcript"
→ Extracts action items automatically

**Friday:** "Close out the week"
→ Generates my weekly report

---

# Here's A Real Example

---

# Revenue Intelligence

AI-powered pipeline dashboard for sales.

- Surfaces deals needing attention
- AI reads recent activity
- Suggests what to do next
- One click to update

---

# How I Built It

**Day 1:** Described the concept to Claude
**Day 2-3:** Built the Apex backend together
**Day 4-5:** Built the Lightning component
**Day 6:** Integrated the AI layer

One week. Not three months.

---

# It's In Production Now

Sales reps use it every day.

I built something I never could have built.

Engineers reviewed it. Gave feedback. Helped me ship it right.

That's the process.

---

# Another Example

---

# Segment Approval Workflows

Multi-level Slack approvals for deals.

**The pieces:**
- Salesforce flow (triggers the process)
- Custom object (tracks approvals)
- Tray workflow (sends to Slack)
- Slack Block Kit (the message UI)
- Record-triggered flow (handles responses)

---

# All Different Types of Work

Not just code.

Planning the architecture.
Building the flow.
Writing the Slack templates.
Designing the error handling.

Claude helped with all of it.

---

# Here's What I've Learned

---

# AI Isn't Just For Code

It's for thinking through problems.
It's for admin work.
It's for spec writing.
It's for debugging.
It's for planning.

Whatever you're stuck on — ask.

---

# The Meeting We Just Had

I processed that transcript already.

Claude extracted:
- Key decisions made
- Action items for me
- Questions to follow up on

That's how I work now.

---

# You Don't Need To Code

You need to know:
- What problem you're solving
- How to describe what you want
- When to push back and iterate

Those are skills you already have.

---

# What Changed

**Before:**
"I wish I could build this."
→ Write a spec → Wait for dev → Maybe get it

**Now:**
"I wish I could build this."
→ Describe it → Build it with AI → Ship it

---

# Start Where You Are

**If you write emails:** Use AI to draft them
**If you run meetings:** Use AI to process transcripts
**If you build reports:** Use AI to analyze data
**If you use Salesforce:** Use AI to build flows

---

# Then Go Further

Once you're comfortable,
try building something.

A small automation.
A simple integration.
A prototype of an idea.

You'll surprise yourself.

---

# The Tools Are Ready

ChatGPT. Claude. Perplexity.

We have access.

The only question is whether you'll use them.

---

# This Is The New Pace

Ideas → Prototypes → Feedback → Ship

Days, not months.

And anyone can do it.

---

# Thank You

# Flow Cheat Sheet

```
0:00 - HOOK
      "I'm not an engineer. But here's what I do now."
      List the types: Apex, flows, components, Slack

      The build timeline
      "One week, not three months"
      In production now

2:30 - EXAMPLE 2: Segment Approvals
      Multiple types of work in one project
      "Claude helped with all of it"

3:15 - WHAT I'VE LEARNED
      AI isn't just for code
      The meeting we just had — already processed
      You don't need to code

4:00 - THE INVITATION
      What changed: before vs now
      Start where you are

# Key Messages

1. **Variety** — Not just code: thinking, admin, integrations, prototypes
2. **Practical** — Real examples: Revenue Intelligence, Approvals workflow
3. **Accessible** — You don't need to code; start where you are
4. **Process** — Use AI to think, not just produce
5. **Incremental** — Start with emails/meetings, then try building

---

# What NOT to Say

- Don't inflate numbers (13K fields aren't mine)
- Don't make it seem like magic (it's iteration)
- Don't oversell speed (some things took multiple tries)
- Don't claim expertise ("I can't write code from scratch")
- Don't ignore the learning curve

---

# Artifacts to Show

1. **Revenue Intelligence screenshot** — production UI
2. **Approval workflow diagram** — shows multiple types of work
3. **Account Page mockup** — prototype example
4. **Terminal/Claude Code** — optional, shows the process

---

# If Asked Questions

**"What do you start with if you've never used AI?"**
> "Start with something you already do. Emails, meeting notes, a report. Just ask for help. See what happens."

**"How long did it take to get good at this?"**
> "I'm still learning. But I got useful results within the first week. It's about iteration, not expertise."

**"What about sensitive data?"**
> "Be thoughtful. Don't paste customer data. Use it for structure, logic, and drafts — not sensitive content."

---

# If Technical Questions Come Up

**"What about code quality?"**
> "Everything gets code review before it ships. That's how I learn what good looks like."

**"What about security?"**
> "Same process as any other code — review, feedback, iterate. I'm not bypassing anything."

**"Are you really coding?"**
> "I'm describing problems and iterating on solutions. The AI writes the syntax. That's the new skill."

# Sales Agent Context

## Why Ambient AI Matters

Clinician burnout from EHR burden reduces efficiency and revenue. Ambient AI tools like **Abridge** automate clinical documentation, cutting administrative work and cognitive load.

### Core ROI Metrics

* **Burnout & cognitive load:** ↓ after-hours EHR use (WOW8), ↓ NASA-TLX scores, ↑ retention.
* **Financial:** ↑ wRVUs/encounter, ↑ HCC capture, ↑ net margin.
* **Efficiency:** ↑ same-day chart closures, ↓ documentation time.

---

## Proven Abridge Outcomes

### Clinician Well-being

* **61% cognitive load reduction** (clinical trials).
* **73% fewer clinicians** charting after hours; **67% ↓ burnout risk.**
* Riverside Health: **55–62% reduction** in burnout & load.

### Revenue Impact

* **Riverside Health:** +11% wRVUs, +14% HCC capture per encounter.
* Clinicians finish charts **hours earlier** daily.

## Competitor Snapshot

| Vendor | Burnout | Financial | Efficiency |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Nuance DAX** | ↓ admin load | Up to 112% ROI | ↓ backlog |
| **Suki** | 72% ↓ doc time | Limited data | ↓ after-hours work |
| **Ambience** | Early promise | ~$13k/yr gain | Limited data |
| **Augmedix/Others** | Mixed results | Limited/mixed | Variable |

---

## Length of Stay (LoS)

No proven inpatient LoS impact. ROI mainly from **outpatient documentation** (↑ wRVUs, coding accuracy).

---

## Key Sales Talking Points

1. **Clinician burnout relief:** 55–62% ↓ load & burnout.
2. **Revenue lift:** Model 11% wRVU increase by specialty.
3. **Operational gains:** ~9% ↑ same-day note closure, faster charting.
4. **Accuracy:** Clinically validated note quality.
5. **Differentiation:** Peer-reviewed Abridge data vs. anecdotal competitor claims.

---

## Pilot & Measurement

**Recommended metrics:**

* Burnout ↓ → track after-hours EHR time (WOW8).
* Financial validation → wRVU uplift vs. baseline.
* Quality → periodic audit of documentation accuracy.

---

### Step 1: Use Field Reference Tables First

The field reference tables above cover Account, Opportunity, Buying Group, Buying Group Member, Conversation, Account Plan, Task, and Event. **Use them directly — do not run a describe call for these objects.**

For any object NOT listed above, attempt a `FIELDS(ALL)` SOQL query on a single record to discover available fields.

---

### Step 2: Find the Account

Query by name using a case-insensitive partial match:

```sql
SELECT Id, Name, OwnerId, Customer_Health__c, Account_Segment__c,
       Account_Status__c, EMR_Ambulatory_Vendor_F__c, Total_CARR_F__c,
       Active_Users__c, Recording_Users__c, Total_Contracted_Users__c
FROM Account
WHERE Name LIKE '%{search_term}%'
LIMIT 5
```

If multiple results are returned, surface them to the user and ask which account they meant before proceeding. Always confirm the Account `Id` before querying related Opportunities.

---

### Step 3: Query Active Opportunities

Using the confirmed Account `Id`, query open non-renewal Opportunities:

```sql
SELECT Id, Name, StageName, ForecastCategory, CloseDate, NextStep,
       Future_Task_Date_RU__c, Last_Next_Step_Update__c,
       Estimated_Go_Live_Date__c, CARR__c, NRR__c, TCV__c,
       Competitor__c, Product_Type__c, Users__c,
       Hygiene_Percent_F__c, Hygiene_Summary__c, Risk_Summary__c
FROM Opportunity
WHERE AccountId = '{account_id}'
AND IsClosed = false
AND Renewal_Count__c = 0
```

> **Note:** There is no `Is_Renewal__c` boolean. Filter renewals using `Renewal_Count__c = 0` for non-renewals or `Renewal_Count__c > 0` for renewals.

---

### Step 4: Evaluate Pipeline Hygiene

For each open Opportunity, check the built-in hygiene fields first:

| Field | What It Tells You |
|---|---|
| `Hygiene_Percent_F__c` | Overall hygiene score (0–100%) |
| `Hygiene_Next_Step__c` | `true` = Next Step is missing or stale |
| `Hygiene_Next_Activity__c` | `true` = Next Activity Date is missing |
| `Hygiene_No_Contact_Roles__c` | `true` = Contact Roles are missing |
| `Hygiene_Summary__c` | Text summary of hygiene issues |

Then validate against these standards:

| Field | Standard |
|---|---|
| `NextStep` | Must contain a date, initials, and action. Updated weekly (Fri EOD). |
| `Last_Next_Step_Update__c` | Should be within the last 7 days. |
| `Future_Task_Date_RU__c` | Must exist on all open opportunities. |
| `Estimated_Go_Live_Date__c` | Required at Design stage or later. |
| `Competitor__c` | Required at Align stage or later. |
| Contact Roles | Minimum 3 (Exec Sponsor, Economic Buyer, Champion). |
| `CloseDate` | Must align with stage guidelines (see below). |

**Close Date Guidelines by Stage:**

| Stage | Expected Close Date |
|---|---|
| Potential | +120 days |
| Discover | +90–120 days |
| Align | +60–90 days |
| Design | +45–60 days |
| Authorize | +15–45 days |
| Close | +1–30 days |
| Closed Won | Signature date |

Flag any opportunity where the close date does not align with its current stage.

---

### Common Query Patterns

**Top accounts by CARR:**
```sql
SELECT Id, Name, Total_CARR_F__c, Account_Segment__c, Customer_Health__c
FROM Account
WHERE Total_CARR_F__c > 0
ORDER BY Total_CARR_F__c DESC
LIMIT 20
```

**Stale pipeline (Next Step not updated in 7+ days):**
```sql
SELECT Id, Name, StageName, NextStep, Last_Next_Step_Update__c, OwnerId
FROM Opportunity
WHERE IsClosed = false
AND Last_Next_Step_Update__c < LAST_N_DAYS:7
```

**Renewal opportunities closing soon:**
```sql
SELECT Id, Name, StageName, CloseDate, CARR__c, AccountId
FROM Opportunity
WHERE IsClosed = false
AND Renewal_Count__c > 0
AND CloseDate = NEXT_N_DAYS:30
```

**Account health overview:**
```sql
SELECT Id, Name, Customer_Health__c, Customer_Health_Trend__c,
       Total_CARR_F__c, Active_Users__c, Total_Contracted_Users__c
FROM Account
WHERE Account_Status__c = 'Customer'
AND Customer_Health__c IN ('Yellow', 'Red')
```

## Salesforce Forecasting Guide

"**Forecasted to close**" = ForecastCategory `Forecast` (UI: "Commit"). Exclude **Omitted**, **Early**, **Upside**, or **Closed Lost**.

| API Value | UI Display | Stage Examples | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| Pipeline | Pipeline | Discovery, Identified | Early qualification |
| BestCase | Best Case | Proposal, Demo | Mid-stage |
| MostLikely | Most Likely | Quote, Legal | Late-stage |
| Forecast | Commit | Security, Negotiation | High-confidence close |
| Closed | Closed | Closed Won | Successful |
| Omitted | Omitted | Closed Lost, Disqualified | Excluded |

## Pipeline Hygiene & Account Health

Goal: assess **active, non-renewal opportunities** for health and accuracy.

**Process:**

1. **Look up field names** from the reference tables above. Do NOT run describe for Account or Opportunity.
2. **Find the Account** by name using SOQL.
3. **Query active Opportunities** linked to that Account.
4. **Read hygiene fields** — `Hygiene_Percent_F__c`, `Hygiene_Summary__c`, and the individual boolean flags.
5. **Analyze** — identify risks, blockers, and stale fields against the standards above.
6. **Report** — Summary with account health score (0–100) and emojis for quick visual. Include links to relevant Attention calls: `https://app.attention.tech/{conversation_uuid}`

## Global Rules & Best Practices

* **Owner consistency:** Opp owner = Account owner.
* **CARR = primary revenue metric** (NRR for pilots).
* **Epic = primary EMR target.**
* **Close ≠ Closed Won.**
* **Account Plans = best context source** — query via `Current_Account_Plan__c` on Account.
* **Pipeline hygiene:** update `NextStep` weekly (Fri EOD), keep `Future_Task_Date_RU__c` current.
* **Use the field reference tables above** — only call describe for objects not covered.
* **`NextStep` is a standard field** — never query as `Next_Step__c` or `NextStep__c`.
* **`Future_Task_Date_RU__c` is "Next Activity Date"** — never query as `NextActivityDate` or `Next_Activity_Date__c`.
* **Filter renewals with `Renewal_Count__c`** — there is no `Is_Renewal__c` boolean.
* **Hygiene scores are pre-calculated** — read `Hygiene_Percent_F__c` instead of computing manually.

**Stalled Deal Checklist:** What changed since last week → current blocker + mitigation → internal asks to get back on track.

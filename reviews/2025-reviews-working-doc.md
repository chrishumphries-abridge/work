## Peer Review #1: Peter Woolley (Revenue Operations Manager)

### Q1: Contribution to team's success

**Chris's input:**
> Peter and I started on the same day and we're on the same team, so we work together quite closely. Thinking about the past six months, how he's contributed to our team—we've had to do a lot of work around how we rolled out buying groups, how we rolled out compensation. He's a really big key player when it comes to working between the revenue operations team and the sales/commercial teams. He's at the forefront of reporting, compensation, etc. He's really great at being a partner between RevOps and Sales—handling rollouts, end-user support, things like that.

**Final draft:**
> Peter and I started on the same day, so we've worked closely together from the beginning. Over the past six months, he's been a key player in some of our bigger rollouts—buying groups and bringing in our new comp system.
>
> What stands out is how well Peter serves as the connective tissue between RevOps and Sales. He's the one handling rollouts, fielding questions, and providing end-user support. Having someone who can be that consistent partner for the commercial teams has made a real difference in how smoothly things land.

### Q2: Area for improvement

**Chris's input:**
> I don't have a lot here honestly. The only thing I would say is just not being afraid of still diving into the technical—advice I'd give anyone working within different systems or tools. I love working with Peter, no issues. As we continue to work in more technologically focused areas, using more things like AI and different concepts around RevOps, just always making sure you're spending time keeping the technology up to date.

**Final draft:**
> Honestly, Peter is a great partner and I don't have any real friction points to call out. If I had to offer something for his growth, it would just be to keep carving out time to stay hands-on with the technical side of our tools and systems. As RevOps continues to evolve—especially with AI and more tech-focused workflows—staying close to the technical details will only make him more effective. But this is advice I'd give anyone in our space, not a gap I've seen from Peter.

## Peer Review #2: Katherine Oliver (Deal Desk Associate)

### Q1: Contribution to team's success

**Chris's input:**
> Katherine is a ton of fun to work with, and it's pretty amazing that she came into Abridge as a RevOps associate role and then quickly saw an opportunity in how we run our deal desk and totally revolutionized and transformed it. At this point she's gone from being part of the process to being the process. She is crucial to how this deal desk process runs. She's always bringing great and new ideas to improve it. I've really loved working with her to improve Deal Desk and really make it what it is today. She is truly the reason that process runs so well for the business.

**Final draft:**
> Katherine came into Abridge as a RevOps associate and pretty quickly saw an opportunity in how we were running Deal Desk. She didn't just flag it—she took it on and completely transformed it. At this point, she's gone from being part of the process to being the process. Deal Desk runs as well as it does because of her.
>
> She's also always bringing new ideas to improve things, which has made it really fun to partner with her. She's not just maintaining what exists—she's actively making it better.

### Q2: Area for improvement

**Chris's input:**
> I don't have a lot of feedback for Katherine. I would give similar systems-focused feedback. She's in a very demanding job position and always finding ways to protect her space and protect her well-being is important. Being the crucial part of a sales organization and translating the commercial terms of deals to customers/prospects can be very stressful. She handles it well, but always be mindful of making sure she feels mentally okay and able to handle the load.

**Final draft:**
> Two things. First, as RevOps gets more tech-focused—more automation, AI, new tools—I'd encourage Katherine to keep carving out time to go deeper on the technical and systems side. She's already strong operationally, and building that muscle will make her even more effective as Deal Desk evolves.
>
> Second, just staying mindful of bandwidth. She's become so central to this process that it's easy for requests to stack up. Continuing to protect her time and push back when needed will help her stay sustainable in a demanding role.

## Self Review

### Q1: What went well?

**Chris's input:**
> I'm overall just most proud of diving into AI, diving into really figuring out how it works, what systems we have at our disposal, and really just taking a step towards starting to build a strategy for this side of the business. We're an AI company, so obviously using AI internally is really valuable, but it's still tricky when you have so many different LLMs and different models and different ways to access it. I think I've done a good job at diving into that world and coming up with a good understanding—rolling our own combined with other things out there.
>
> The second piece is just a lot of foundational work. We got emails brought into Salesforce. We're bringing Attention calls. We got buying groups set up. A lot of foundational work in the last six months that now makes things like AI a lot stronger. When you have a good data set, AI is that much better.
>
> Third, just understanding the business more. As I've worked on different projects, I've gotten a better understanding of just how Abridge operates.

**Final draft:**
> **1. Building our AI strategy**
> I'm most proud of the work I've done diving into AI—understanding the landscape, what tools and systems we have at our disposal, and starting to shape a real strategy for this side of the business. We're an AI company, so using AI internally should be a given, but the reality is messier: lots of LLMs, different models, different ways to access them. I've spent time figuring out what the right approach actually looks like for us, and I think we've landed in a good place—some version of rolling our own combined with leveraging what's already out there. We now have a solid foundation to build on.
>
> **2. Foundational data work**
> The second piece is less flashy but just as important: foundational work that makes everything else stronger. Over the past six months, we brought emails into Salesforce, started bringing in Attention calls, and got buying groups set up. This kind of work doesn't always get attention, but it's what makes AI actually useful. Good data in, good results out. These investments set us up to capitalize on AI in ways we couldn't have before.
>
> **3. Understanding the business**
> I've also just gotten a much better handle on how Abridge operates. Working across different projects has given me more context on how the pieces fit together—how teams work, how decisions get made, where the priorities are. That understanding makes me more effective in everything else I do.

### Q2: What's one area or skill you want to develop?

**Chris's input:**
> The challenge will be taking everything I've learned so far and applying it to a more holistic AI vision for the company. We've talked a lot about this kind of revenue intelligence product that we've been working on and starting to release. The challenge will be how do we embed AI across Salesforce in our own way? But also how do we tie that back to a design system and a backend system that's not spaghetti code everywhere else? I also want to find ways to level others up too—make sure that as I'm gathering this knowledge, I'm also sharing it in a helpful way.

**Final draft:**
> The area I want to grow in is designing a more holistic AI architecture for the business. I've spent the past six months learning our systems, laying foundational data work, and experimenting with what's possible. Now the challenge is pulling that together into something cohesive.
>
> We've been building toward a revenue intelligence product, and the next step is figuring out how to embed AI across Salesforce in a way that's genuinely ours—not just bolted-on tools, but something intentional. At the same time, I want to make sure what we build connects back to a clean design system and backend architecture, not spaghetti code scattered everywhere.
>
> I also want to get better at bringing others along. As I gather this knowledge, I want to find ways to share it that actually help the team—whether that's documentation, walkthroughs, or just making the systems easier to understand. Building something great matters less if no one else can work with it.

## Upward Review: Zack Blois (Manager)

### Q1: How has your manager helped enable your success?

**Chris's input:**
> Zack has now been my manager at two companies, and he's still my favorite manager I've had in my career so far. He's just a great person, a great partner to work with, and a great leader. He is awesome at giving me the space I need to figure things out, work on different ideas. He gives me plenty of bandwidth and time to work through things, work through different ideas, different thoughts, and also has a great sounding board.
>
> He's also great at keeping things grounded and keeping things focused as well, and has the right balance of getting the fundamentals right but also chasing the new cool things as well.
>
> On a personal note: I've gone through a challenging personal time this year navigating a health issue. Zack has been nothing but incredible through it all—always supportive and always okay with whatever I need to do. I've tried hard to keep things simple and not take too much time off, but he's always been great giving me the space I needed to work through what I've been dealing with.

**Final draft:**
> Zack has now been my manager at two companies, and he's still the best manager I've had in my career. He's a great partner and a great leader.
>
> What I value most is the space he gives me to figure things out. He doesn't micromanage or hover—he trusts me to work through ideas, explore different approaches, and come back when I have something to share. That freedom has been huge for me, especially in a role where I'm often exploring new territory like AI strategy and systems design. At the same time, he's always available as a sounding board. When I have questions or half-formed ideas, he's great at helping me think through them without taking over.
>
> He also has a strong sense of balance. He knows when to keep things grounded and focused on fundamentals, and when it's worth chasing something new. That's not easy—a lot of managers lean too hard one way or the other. With Zack, I feel like I can pursue new ideas without losing sight of what actually matters, and that's made me more effective.
>
> On a personal note, I went through a challenging health situation this year, and Zack has been nothing but incredible through it. He gave me the space and flexibility I needed to navigate it without any pressure or hesitation. I've tried to keep things simple and not take too much time away from work, but just knowing he had my back made a real difference. It's the kind of support that's hard to find, and I really appreciate him for it.

### Q2: What's one suggestion to help them be more effective as a manager?

**Chris's input:**
> There are times when I don't get clarity from him in areas. There's times when, as we take on new ideas and challenges, he can be a little reserved or not sure. Sometimes I want to encourage him to take a step and see what happens rather than always playing it safe. Example: during buying groups project, it started drifting toward technical details and away from the purpose, and he stayed hands-off rather than stepping in.

**Final draft:**
> If I had to offer something, it would be for Zack to weigh in more when projects start to drift. There are times when I think he sees things going off course—whether it's scope creeping, focus shifting to the wrong details, or a project moving away from its original purpose—but he hangs back rather than stepping in to redirect. He has the context and perspective to help keep things on track, and the team trusts his judgment. I'd encourage him to lean into that more and speak up earlier when he sees something drifting. It would help the team stay aligned and avoid some of the course corrections we end up making later.

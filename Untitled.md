Hey Ben,

I wanted to circle back around to you on this. At this point in time, we don't have Salesforce configured in a way to be exposed to third-party or custom projects quite yet. We're working on the security framework to get there. We're also working with IT to get an MCP server that would allow us to service this context in a safer way. So, we don't have an answer to this right yet, but it's coming.

What I can do is either give you an export of some Salesforce data to work with in the meantime, or work with Claude to build mock data.
